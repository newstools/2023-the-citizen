Abu-Jamal is considered a political prisoner as supporters argue that his conviction of killing a Philadelphia police officer is wrongful, and is a cover-up for state repression of his political work. Speaking at the Union Buildings in Pretoria, where the march commenced, Numsa national organiser, Ndiki Zwelohlanga said they want to put pressure on US judges to release Abu-Jamal. “This is a wrongful arrest. Someone who is accused of the murder that he never did, he is an activist.” Speaking to The Citizen, Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said the they have been on the campaign with Abu-Jamal for many years. “This is not the first time we’ve reached out to leaders in the American government to respond from a humanitarian perspective on the plight of Mumia Abu-Jamal. In 2016, the general secretary of Numsa, Irvin Jim, wrote a letter to then governor of Philadelphia, Thomas Westerman Wolf. At the time, Abu-Jamal needed lifesaving Hepatitus medication and the governor was denying him that treatment while he was in prison. We campaigned and were part of the global campaign, and he eventually go the treatment,” Hlubi-Majola said. Majola said locally there is a lot of pressure on the US government surrounding the immediate release of Abu-Jamal. “All we are doing is amplifying the message from our end because we believe it is time that he should be set free and his continued incarceration would be a violation of human rights.” ALSO READ: WATCH: Striking Nehawu workers meet their match in Westbury
