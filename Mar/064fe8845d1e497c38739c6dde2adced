Former Malaika star Matshediso “Tshedi” Mholo has shared that the sudden death of young artist Constantinos “Costa Titch” Tsobanoglou has triggered her.  The singer, who was part of the iconic Afro-pop music group Malaika, said she has experienced her own bandmates collapsing in front of her.  Costa Titch died after collapsing on stage during a performance at Ultra on Saturday evening, he was 27 years old. On Sunday, Mholo tweeted that some death reports, unfortunately, conjure up unpleasant memories.  She said: “Some deaths… are such triggers. I experienced both Malaika members collapsing before my eyes on different occasions. While one went for surgery, one collapsed with me at the airport”. Malaika members also included Bongani Nchang and the late Jabulani Ndaba. Ndaba passed away in 2008, at 32 years old, after a battle with tuberculosis.  The singer further writes she received no therapy after witnessing these traumatic incidents and added she is writing a book about her life and career.  “No therapy nothing… we lost one member and no therapy still from record label or management. Look out for my autobiography… before [the] end of this year.”  Concluding, Mholo said: “Everything happened before my eyes, from [the] stage we rushed him [Ndaba] to the theatre. At some point, my car was an ambulance, out of panic. Haai maan. And we expected to be hurled with insults when choosing our peace. [South Africans] we can do better”. 😭😭😭😭 everything happened before my eyes..from stage we rushed him to Theatre..At some point my car was an ambulance..out of panic..Haai maan..😥😰😭And we expected to be hurled with insults when choosing our peace..

She wrote a touching message on her Instagram page on Sunday, sharing videos of their moments together.  She said: “This one hits harder cause I was just talking to you a few hours ago. “You were one of [the] few selfless and caring humans I’ve ever known in my life. You were so kind, so good at your craft, so damn hardworking and yet so humble. Your humility got me every time.” ALSO READ: Tributes pour in for Costa Titch “I’m deeply shattered by your passing, Costa.
