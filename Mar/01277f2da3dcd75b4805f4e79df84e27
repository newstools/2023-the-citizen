The Blitzboks set up a table-topping Pool B decider against Argentina on Saturday after a convincing win and last-minute draw on day one at the Canada Sevens. A late try by skipper Siviwe Soyizwapi and a clutch conversion by Ricardo Duarttee helped the South Africans level matters after the buzzer 19-19 against France in their opening clash at BC Place. The Blitzboks then brushed aside Japan 40-12 in their second match, after leading 26-0 at half time, as Sandile Ngcoboâ€™s charges look to make amends for a disappointing LA leg of the 2022-23 World Series last week.
