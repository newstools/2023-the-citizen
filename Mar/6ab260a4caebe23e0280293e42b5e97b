For the second Test in a row Proteas captain Temba Bavuma won the toss and chose to bat first in the final Test of the series against the West Indies at Wanderers in Johannesburg on Wednesday morning. It has been a new dawn for the Proteas under new leadership of coach Shukri Conrad and captain Bavuma, and they won the first Test at Centurion last week comfortably by 87-runs in under three days.
