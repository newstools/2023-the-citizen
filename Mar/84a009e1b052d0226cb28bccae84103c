The midfielder is mostly featured on the bench, but game time has been lacking. The source says Radebe was supposed to have left Chiefs in the January transfer window, but the management and Zwane thought it was best for him to fight for a place in the starting line-up.

There is something that is missing in his game. He is not like Mduduzi (Tshabalala), that one is so confident and that’s what helps him. Sabelo is not, he is scared to play. That is why they (management) have decided to send him on loan.”
