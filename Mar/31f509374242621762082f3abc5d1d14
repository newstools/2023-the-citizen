Usuthu had a decent start in the game and a good play by Hendrick Ekstein saw the midfielder setting up striker Gabadinho Mhango, but he was unfortunate to be denied by the upright in the 22nd minute. Two minutes later, the KwaZulu-natal club had another great chance – this time it was Ekstein who could have given the visitors the lead, but his chipped effort went inches wide of Dondol goalkeeper Sphamandla Gumede’s poles. From that Usuthu attack, the home team had their first chance of the match after going on a counter-attack, with Katiso Seema’s attempt went off target. The start of the second was a bit slow and it took 55 minutes of play to finally see a goal in the match thanks to a composed finish by Ekstein from inside the box to make it 1-0 for AmaZulu. However, it was Dondol who would get the all-important equaliser courtesy of Revaldo Fox’s shot from close range after his initial header was blocked by AmaZulu defenders in the 60th minute.
