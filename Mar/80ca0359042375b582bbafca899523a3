Parliament’s ethics committee has recommended that former mineral resources minister Mosebenzi Zwane be suspended as a Member of Parliament (MP) for one term. The recommended suspension is harsher than the usual 30 days suspension, a fine of no more than a month’s salary, or a reprimand in the House. It comes after the DA and the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) laid complaints against Zwane in 2017. The committee found his appointment as minister of mineral resources was orchestrated by the Guptas. They did this to secure the purchase of the Optimum coal mine by their company Tegeta. It also found that he failed to disclose benefits and hospitality he received from the Guptas. One of the complaints was that Zwane travelled on a private jet from Zurich to Dubai in the company of Tony Gupta and Salim Essa. He then spent two days in India with the Guptas before flying back to Johannesburg.

He was also accused of misleading Parliament when asked about his interactions with the Guptas. The committee also found Zwane failed to provide evidence to confirm that the travel, hotel stay, and chauffeur driver in Dubai was not paid for by the Guptas. He also did not provide documents confirming that he paid for these himself. For issuing the press statement, the committee wants Zwane to apologise to the National Assembly. The Ethics Committee recommended sanction will now need to be approved by the House. NOW READ: ANC ‘enforces’ step-aside rule on Mosebenzi Zwane after arrest on corruption charges
