The World Bank has approved a concessional loan and grants totaling $579.93 million for financing the Tanzania Sustainable Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme and the Tanzania Maternal and Child Health Investment Programme. Through the financing, at least ten million people will gain access to improved water supplies, while nine million will have improved sanitation facilities. World Bank country director Nathan Belete, Finance and Planning minister Mwigulu Nchemba, Health deputy minister Godwin Mollel, and Zanzibar health director Amour Suleiman Mohamed represented the two sides at the signing ceremony. Under the arrangement, the World Bank will extend $300 million in credit and $4.93 million in grant funding to improve access to water supply and sanitation in Tanzania. "We expect up to 10 million Tanzanian citizens will gain access to improved water supply and 9 million to improved sanitation facilities. Also, up to 2,500 healthcare facilities and over 1,600 primary schools will be provided with adequate sanitation and hygiene services," Mr Belete said.
