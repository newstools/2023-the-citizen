Wayne Parnell and Tabraiz Shamsi have been added to the Proteas ODI squad for the three-match series against the West Indies, starting on Thursday. Parnell replaces all-rounder Wiaan Mulder in the squad, while Shamsi comes in for Keshav Maharaj, who is also injured. Mulder picked up a grade one side strain during the recent second Test against the West Indies at the Wanderers, while Maharaj hurt his Achilles during the match. South Africa go into the ODI series having won the two Test matches between the teams at SuperSport Park and the Wanderers respectively. This will be the first series of new coach Rob Walter’s tenure as Proteas white-ball coach. The Proteas will also face the West Indies in three T20s after the ODI series. Temba Bavuma, fresh off scoring his second Test century, a magnificent 172 in the second Test at the Wanderers, will lead the ODI side, while Aiden Markram, who was named player of the series in the Tests, will be in charge of the T20 team. The squad for the first and second ODIs will assemble in East London on Monday.
