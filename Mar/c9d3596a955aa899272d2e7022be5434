Uefa said on Tuesday it will reimburse all Liverpool supporters who attended last year’s chaos-hit Champions League final between the English club and Real Madrid at the Stade de France in Paris. Heavily criticised in an independent report published last month for organisational failures which “almost led to disaster”, European football’s governing body said its refund scheme would cover the entire Liverpool allocation of nearly 20 000, as well as supporters of Real and other spectators affected by the trouble outside the stadium.

Police then fired tear gas towards thousands of supporters locked behind metal fences on the perimeter to the stadium. Uefa tried to pin the blame on Liverpool fans arriving late despite thousands having been held for hours outside the stadium before kick-off.
