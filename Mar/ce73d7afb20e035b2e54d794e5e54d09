Everybody knows there is not a snowball’s hope in hell of an ANC Cabinet minister resigning for his or her department’s failures, as happened this week in Greece in the wake of the tragic train accident which claimed more than 30 lives.  That country’s transport minister, Kostas Karamanlis, resigned within hours of the disaster, stating that government efforts to improve the rail system “were sadly not enough to prevent such an accident”.

Leaving aside that there have been derailments on his watch, the near-destruction of our rail network has already badly hurt our economy … and led to job losses and suffering. That can lead to death, too.  However, much as we would like to see Mbaks fall on his sword, we realise that, sadly, it will make no difference.
