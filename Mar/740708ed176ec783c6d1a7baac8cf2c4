Dar es Salaam. Tanzania top runner Alphonce Simbu has said his unsuccessful attempts to win a medal in the Olympic Games give him a headache. Simbu, who has already secured Olympic Games and World Athletics qualifying marks, said he is not happy to see he is struggling to win a medal at the multisport event. The long distance runner has earned the qualifying mark after winning a bronze medal in a marathon held in Japan, where he clocked 2:06:19 at the Osaka Castle Park. The result means that Simbu has qualified for competing in the World Championships scheduled to take place in August this year in Budapest, Hungary. “I won a medal in the World Athletics Championships last year, I won a silver medal at the Commonwealth Games, why not the Olympic Games? I will never retire from the game till I win a medal in the Olympic Games. Good enough, I will compete in the World Athletics Championships in Hungary in August and later start preparing for the Paris Olympic Games,” said Simbu. According to Simbu, he will train intensively ahead of the two major events. “The secret behind my success is intensive training. I have been exchanging ideas with other runners who have managed to win gold medals in many events. They tell me to train hard and increase my pace,” he said. Simbu also commended his employers for their big support in his career. “As you know, I am employed and I have to seek permission in order to feature in various competitions. I’m given big support,” he said. Simbu is now among the five runners who are under the sponsorship of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) through Olympic Solidarity. His best record in such events was in 2019 when he won a bronze medal and at the Rio 2016 Olympics, finishing fifth in a marathon.
