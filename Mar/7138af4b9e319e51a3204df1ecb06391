Getting to know them football wise on the pitch and also off the pitch, I think that relationship between a player and a coach is important. I need to know what makes them tick,” said the former AmaZulu FC and Swallows FC coach. “And also the tactical changes, the playing style, formation, agreements, principles and the playing model had to be instilled.
