Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya held a media briefing on Sunday, saying President Cyril Ramaphosa will announce changes to his cabinet on Monday.  The briefing follows after widespread public speculation regarding Ramaphosa’s health – which Magwenya says is nothing more than a common cold – and the Ankole auction. Magwenya said Ramaphos will address the nation at 7pm on Monday evening, 6 March to announce the changes to his cabinet.  Furthermore, he said the cabinet was never postponed due to his health, since there “was no plan for the president to announce the cabinet changes on Thursday, 2 March.”  As a result, there was no postponement or cancellation of such an announcement. He added that Ramaphosa is “fully seized with and committed to his oath of office and day-to-day tasks of leading the nation out of the difficulties we face.” When asked why Ramaphosa didn’t address the media directly on Sunday, Magwenya said a “wave of speculation has been doing the rounds” in South Africa.  “[The president] has been in consultation and other parliamentary processes where he is needed to take account,” Magwenya said.

The dates for these events were scheduled a number of months ago.” Despite being in discomfort due to his ill health, Magwenya said the president “made a brief stop at Friday’s dinner to greet guests.” He clarified: “President Ramaphosa did not attend the auction itself the following day as his cold persisted and required that he should rest.” RELATED: Delay in Ramaphosa’s cabinet reshuffle hints at ANC calling the shots
