Motloung says there is a lot of positivity around the team to do well against the Sea Robbers, and they believe that they can cause an upset. “This competition is full of surprises, we have seen it happen a lot of times over the years. Remember what Maluti did to Pirates? There is also TS Galaxy who won the tournament after beating Chiefs in the final. So, anything is possible here and we want to be counted among the history makers of the Nedbank Cup,” said the experienced Motloung, who also played for Polokwane City when they were still in the top flight. “The guys are in high spirits ahead of this match. It has been like that since the draw and we have been working a lot to make sure that we will be ready for the match. We know we are coming up against a good team which has done really well as of late, but this is a tournament and what matters most is what you do on the day.” VFA, however, have been inconsistent in the Motsepe Foundation Championship and the team is in 14th place on the league standings.
