Making a cake appears to be a tall order until you make it yourself especially if you pick an easy cake recipe that will have incredible results.  For those emergency family functions, late birthday parties or you simply forgot to make a sweet treat, an easy cake recipe goes a long way.  This classic British Victorian sponge cake is fluffy goodness and it’s a basic cake that can be dressed up with some jam, whipped cream, berries, buttercream icing, lemon curd, chocolate spread and more. You can eat it as is or add your favourite buttercream frosting in the middle like my mum did, along with a layer of homemade raspberry jam. On top, sprinkle with powdered sugar or leave plain, cut, and serve.
