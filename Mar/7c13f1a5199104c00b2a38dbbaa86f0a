The Real Housewives of Durban star Sorisha Naidoo recently spoke about a “wealth bracelet” during an afternoon out with her co-star Slindile Wendy Ndlovu (Slee) and now everyone on social media wants one. During their meeting at a fabric shop, Slee confided in Sorisha about her spiritual journey.  She then noted the threaded bracelet that Sorisha often wears which she explained as a prayer in the Hindu culture for wealth.   Sorisha noted that Slee also had threaded bracelets of her own and took the opportunity to ask her what hers are for.  “You know, that red string, we tie it every year, once a year, and it lasts me year to year. It’s a prayer in the Hindu culture for wealth.

Often called ‘Viv’ by those closest to him, Reddy is a South African Indian of South Indian descent and the founder of the Edison Group.  Over the decades, he has amassed a business empire with interests in energy, casinos, healthcare, financial services and property development.

These knots symbolise the eight kinds of wealth that are established.” According to a report by The Post, during the month of August, Hindu people invoke the blessings of the Goddess Lutchmee (Lutchmee Prayers). “In South Africa, this prayer is usually observed in the morning in many homes by of­fering fruit, milk, coconut, and sweet rice to the deity to invoke her divine blessing. Pieces of red sacred string/ cotton are also placed in front of the deity’s statue or photograph to be blessed by Mother Lutchmee,” read part of the report by The Post.  Bracelet ele ya Sorisha ya wealth, I need it 🤭— LONG LIVE MEGA!
