However, Nehawu heard about this and have since shut down the two mortuaries.  Nehawu secretary in the Harry Gwala region Mazwi Ngubane said both Richmond and Howick mortuaries have been closed and no other mortuaries are open in the region. The situation at Fort Napier mortuary is extremely bad. Some of the bodies are decomposing. Funerals will have to be postponed Ngubane said they allowed three bodies to be taken out of Greyâ€™s Hospital on Wednesday since they were being taken to private mortuaries around Pietermaritzburg. Asked to comment, KZN police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker said they had not experienced any issues. Police are trained to deal with all crisis situations and will assist wherever there is a need.  Sources from two local mortuaries who asked not to be named said the situation was getting worse and if the strike continued, there would be more backlogs.
