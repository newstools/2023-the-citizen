Women Fund Trust Tanzania (WFT) managing director Janet Mawinza, has called on society to continue with the fight against sexual bribery countrywide. According to her, WFT has been campaigning against sexual bribery under the theme, ‘Break the silence, Tanzania without sexual bribery, is possible ’ This, she says means girls and women should report on any form of  sexual bribe incidents that take place in offices, schools and even at home. She called on the entire society to double efforts to end sexual bribery in the country. Ms Mawinza said that after she lost her job due to sexual bribery at her place of work, she and her husband decided to spread education on the challenge starting with women groups where she was a member. “I found out that their awareness and education on sexual bribery was still very low, but after sharing some stories with them they understood and decided to support the movement,” she said. To put emphasis on the movement WFT has since gone on to collaborate with religious leaders, schools, gender desks in Dar es Salaam. “We then decided to conduct a door to door campaign to make sure the whole society is aware and educated on the issue of sexual bribery,” she said. Ms Mawinza said as for today the organisation has succeed as it  have more than six thousands motorcycle drivers who help in popularizing campaign by wearing reflector jackets.
