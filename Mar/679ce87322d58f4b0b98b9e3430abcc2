Dar es Salaam. When Ms Samia Suluhu Hassan came into office nearly two years ago, Tanzania was on a completely different trajectory. President Hassan has since presided over a raft of reforms that have changed the direction the country was taking under her predecessor, Dr John Pombe Magufuli, who died in office on March 17, 2021. Ms Hassan was sworn in as Tanzania’s first female President on March 19, 2021 when the nation was still mourning the death of Dr Magufuli, who was nicknamed “the bulldozer” for his uncompromising leadership style.

After she was sworn in, President Hassan declared 14 days of national mourning and called for unity among Tanzanians. “This is the time to stand together and be united. It’s time to bury our differences, promote love among us and look into the future with confidence. “This isn’t the time to start pointing accusing fingers at one other. We should hold hands and move forward in building a new Tanzania that President Magufuli endeavoured to build,” she added. However, two years down the road, Tanzania has made a clean break with Magufuli’s mostly hardline policies in various spheres.  Covid-19 stance The first major test President Hassan faced was the raging Covid-19 pandemic, which Magufuli had dismissed as a hoax.

At one point, he declared that the virus had been eradicated from Tanzania by prayer. However, President Hassan, then in office for only a few weeks, appointed a committee of experts to advise her on the way forward and propose measures to keep Tanzanians safe. Not surprisingly, the team’s proposals included the resumption of regular publication of Covid data, some 13 months after the government last released statistics on the disease. President Hassan also appeared in public wearing a facemask and encouraged Tanzanians to do so to protect themselves and others, something her predecessor had never done.

The Head of State made it clear that people would not be forced to accept vaccination. President Hassan also pledged that Tanzania would be guided solely by science in its war on Covid-19.  Teen mothers back to school In November 2021, the government announced that teen mothers would be allowed to continue with their studies, reversing a policy that was unilaterally imposed by Magufuli.

That will never happen under my watch,” he said. Read: Uproar over JPM ban on teen mothers The decision was widely condemned by development partners and human rights campaigners. The World Bank suspended a $300 million loan for girls’ education following Magufuli’s ban.  More freedom A few weeks after her swearing-in, President Hassan reached out to the Opposition, vowing to defend democracy and basic freedoms. In April 2021, she directed that the indefinite ban slapped on a number of media outlets by the previous administration be lifted. “I’m told that you revoked the licences of some media outlets, including online television stations. You should lift the ban, but advise them to follow the law and relevant guidelines. Let’s not give them an opportunity to say that we are limiting press freedom,” she added.

President Hassan also restored political freedom in January 2023 when she lifted the ban imposed on Opposition political rallies in 2016.

National Assembly clerk Nenelwa Mwihambi, who announced the resumption of the live broadcasts, popularly known as “Bunge Live”, said they would begin afresh following renovation of Parliament’s studio and approval by the Steering Committee. Read: Tanzania Parliament to resume live broadcast The government pulled the plug on live broadcasts in 2016, citing “high operating costs” and the need for people to concentrate on their work instead of watching what was going on in Parliament.  Reforming justice President Hassan is currently focusing on reforming the justice system and has already appointed a team to review the institutions responsible for justice. The team will investigate, among other things, the performance of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), Police Force, Judiciary, Drug Control and Enforcement Agency, as well as Tanzania Prisons Service.

Pending issues Despite these reforms, there are still pending issues which the Opposition and activists think President Hassan needs to act on to further improve human rights and other basic freedoms.
