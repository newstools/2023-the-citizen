GREYVILLE TURF 12 March 2023 BEST BET RACE 2 NO 3 GOLDEN PEACE – WIN This Gold Standard gelding had his first race at Kenilworth and it was a promising run over a distance too short on breeding. The horse who won that race went on to run a 0.70-length fourth in a Non-Black Type feature, franking the maiden form. Golden Peace is back in KZN, is going over 1400m this time and is well drawn at No 3.  VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 5 ONE TOO MANY – EACHWAY Overall it’s tricky racing at Greyville today but this four-year-old gelding has been quite consistent. He goes particularly well for jockey Kabelo Matsunyane who has a record of two wins and two places in his four rides.  At 10-1 he looks decent value in this race.
