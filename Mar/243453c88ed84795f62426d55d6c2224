It’s becoming an increasing crisis on the world’s health front, with the growing number of people becoming obese. Miss South Africa’s first runner-up Ayanda Thabethe is helping people get healthy with recipes for World Obesity Day.  World Obesity Day is marked on 4 March, and helps to change misconceptions surrounding obesity while taking effective and collective action.  In a statement, the Miss SA organisation says it has projected from World Obesity Day information that 1.9 billion people globally will be living with obesity in 2035.  This will have a massive impact on the economy as trillions of dollars will be spent on compacting obesity and it’s estimated 1 in 4 people will be considered obese by 2035.  With Ayanda Thabethe representing SA for Miss Supranational this year, the beauty queen is on a mission to get people to eat healthy meals, particularly in combatting food insecurity.  Thabethe provided nutritional recipes to help people struggling with their weight. Thabethe is in the final year of a BSc in Dietetics and Human Nutrition at the University of KwaZulu-Natal.  This recipe is courtesy of Ayanda Thabethe and the Miss SA organisation
