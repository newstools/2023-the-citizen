Maraschino Syrup: When you purchase a jar of maraschino cherries, the syrup tends to be waterlogged and not as sweet as a syrup would be. Measure out the liquid contents and cook with sugar and cherries, to create a sweeter syrup. It’s two parts liquid to one part sugar until the sugar is dissolved.
