The club have an option to renew Ralani’s contract for another year, but Mokwena, who seems to lean towards using younger players, is understood to be willing to let go of Ralani. “When Mokwena and Manqoba Mngqithi were co-head coaches, both would make suggestions on who to bring to help beef up the squad.
