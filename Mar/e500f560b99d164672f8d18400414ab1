He said Makgoe turned the Free State into a winning province through his work and leadership in the Education department. “This is indeed a big blow to the Free State province and the entire country. “Comrade Tade demonstrated that he cared for education and he demonstrated that in his CV that you need to be a life-long learner,” said Dukwana.
