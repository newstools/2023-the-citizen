Axed ActionSA councillor Nkele Molapo says she has launched an urgent application in the High Court in Pretoria to interdict the filling of her vacancy in the party.  The party terminated her membership on Monday for allegedly leaking party information to her husband, Abel Tau, who was expelled in November 2022.

The party also accused Molapo of “coordinating with some of our councillors who do not support the multiparty coalition’s decision to support the vote for a new coalition mayor in the City of Tshwane”.  ActionSA and the Democratic Alliance (DA) said they would hunt for councillors who “betrayed” them by backing the ANC-EFF in Tshwane, which saw Murunwa Makwarela elected as mayor. The parties have since given members polygraph tests.
