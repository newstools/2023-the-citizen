There are certain types of vegetables and fruits that South Africans aren’t too familiar with, particularly those from West Africa to Southeast Asia, this includes okra which is largely associated with meals in Nigeria. Okra is also known as gumbo in parts of Africa and America. It’s a summer vegetable nicknamed ladies fingers, it is a flowering plant in the mallow family and has edible green seed pods. In South Africa, you will likely find them at retailers such as Food Lovers Market or a local food and veg shop.  Okra recipes are normally used in stews, they can be baked in the oven or deep fried, popped in an air fryer and are perfect in Nigerian okra soup.  This okra recipe has a twist with Mediterranean flavours with more accessible ingredients in your pantry, easier than going on the hunt for several other ingredients in traditional okra recipes from West Africa and South East Asia.  You can add meat to this recipe.
