Multi-Choice Tanzania’s managing director Jackline Woiso has called upon women to sacrifice themselves in order to address multi responsibilities. Speaking at 'The Citizen Rising Woman Initiative' gala night held on Wednesday, March 8, Ms Woiso said, there is a need for resilience for any woman who is hungry to make it in any career, especially as a leader. “It’s never easy; it needs personal integrity, accountability and learning from day-to-day situations which sometimes results into frustration,” she said. She added: You need to separate the self from the institution so that whatever you do doesn't compromise the organisation’s reputation” She went on to say, there is need for boys and men inclusion in changing perception of different things and make them know that men and women are dependent on one another.
