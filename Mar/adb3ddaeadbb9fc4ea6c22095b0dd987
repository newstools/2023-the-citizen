RACE 1: NO 6 MIA FIORE – WIN Although this is a work riders’ race, this Lucky Houdalakis-trained runner stands heads andshoulders above the opposition. This filly ran well on debut, and although she has been restedfor four months, she is confidently expected to win. RACE 9: NO 3 MIA REGINA – EACHWAY This filly has just changed stables and takes a mighty drop in class. Her merit rating has fallen,Rachel Venniker rides and that gives Tony Peter’s charge a further 1.5kg off her back. At 6-1 this looks a decent each-way bet.
