Dar es Salaam. As women across the world celebrate International Women’s Day, the Tanzania Private Sector Foundation (TPSF) says it is committed to leveraging innovation and technology to create an enabling environment for women in business across Tanzania. TPSF’s commitment was stated through a message from its chairman, Ms Angelina Ngalula, on March 8, as women are celebrated across the globe with the year's theme, "DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality." Ms Ngalula said their commitment comes as Tanzania’s women entrepreneurs face numerous challenges, including limited access to finance; only 7.8% of women have access to bank loans, compared to 22% of men. Other challenges include access to markets, information, and participation in the formal economy. However, innovation and technology provide opportunities to overcome these challenges by providing access to new markets, financing, and information. “As the TPSF, we will continue to advocate for policies and programs that promote gender equality in access to technology, financing, and markets. We will also provide capacity building and mentorship programs to support women entrepreneurs in developing their technology skills and integrating technology into their businesses," she said. This, according to her, will create more jobs for women in the economy, expand decent work, broaden women’s access to and control over productive resources, and develop gender-responsive economic plans. "On this International Women's Day, we call upon all stakeholders, including the government, private sector, civil society, and development partners, to join us in our efforts to harness the power of innovation and technology to empower women in business in Tanzania. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and prosperous society, where women can fully participate and contribute to the economy and poverty is alleviated,” Ms Ngalula expressed.
