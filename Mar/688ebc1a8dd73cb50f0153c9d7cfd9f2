But with neither of the two making serious advances, AmaZulu have emerged as Mmodi’s next possible home. “AmaZulu are the only team who came with a serious offer but they were told to wait a little,” said a source. “I think it was because his management were holding out to see if Chiefs or Pirates came through before they considered other options.” Mmodi’s deal at Arrows is set to end in June.
