Why the fuss about Monday’s shutdown? Let’s look from a statistical perspective what it means. South Africa has a population of 69 million.  Of this, 53% are unemployed according to the expanded definition, 33% are under the age of 18, and 7% are retired. Add it up and we see that this comprises 93% of our population. That leaves only 7% – or 4.83 million people – supposedly active in the economy.  Of these, 2.1 million are government employees and judged on the levels of service delivery, it’s totally irrelevant whether they pitch up at work or not, as they seem to be on a permanent shutdown.

Statistics also show that on any given day, 15% of the total workforce is off sick, but this spikes to 20% on Mondays. That’s a sickening statistic in itself, but that’s the truth. With 45% of the 2.73 million also out of action, we are down to 1 501 500 people.  But we still have to subtract the 1.1 million university students (private and public), 160 000 prisoners, 110 000 people in hospitals, and 9 766 politicians leaving us with 121 734.

So, if Julius Malema wants to shut down the country, just send me a note: I will stay home. Problem solved.
