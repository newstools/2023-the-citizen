As South Africans begin their Monday mornings and head to work, traffic delays are being reported due to the Nehawu public service strike. The National Education, Health, and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) said it submitted an application for leave to appeal; the strike will proceed as planned. Burning tyres and protest action is taking place near Leratong Hospital.  Medical personnel line up down the road; they aren’t allowed access to the premises.  Updates will be shared below. Services vital to the public – such as healthcare and education – will be impacted. Cosatu reminded members this is a protected protest. Meanwhile, Nehawu said the strike underscores the significance of public servants.  “Members are informed that we have filed the application for leave to appeal the interdict.  “The filling of the appeal effectively suspends the order, as such, the [protest] is proceeding today. Aluta Continua!” To our NoB's @NEHAWU, please don't land the plane before all demands are met,  ningangxami zinkokheli, this employer must feel our wrath, pain, and suffering.

Nehawu claims the government pressures public servants and forces them to endure severe poverty, exacerbating inequality and record-breaking unemployment. “Government expects public servants to accede to a pathetic three percent wage increase that was unilaterally implemented after the majority of public servants at the Public Service Coordinating Council (PSCBC) have rejected it. Nehawa said it is clear “government is hellbent on collapsing collective bargaining, reversing the gains of workers and undermining workers’ rights.”
