Tshabalala believes they could have scored more goals in this tie especially after creating a number of scoring opportunities. “We always find it difficult when we come to Polokwane, but we created a lot of goal-scoring opportunities in the first half and I believe we should have buried the game as early as possible, in terms of us trying to break them at the back it was pretty difficult,” said Tshabalala. “As soon as we scored, we knew that we were going to get more goals, but we took the foot off the paddle instead of pressing them higher. I think that’s what made us think it is going to be a walk in the park for us.” Meanwhile, midfielder Hlogi Mashigo said it was important for Banyana Ba Style to get their last minute goal and they are aiming at winning 10 games in a row.
