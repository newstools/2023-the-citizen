The African National Congress (ANC) has refuted claims that there is tension between President Cyril Ramaphosa and his new deputy, Paul Mashatile. Delays around the Cabinet reshuffle had sparked rumours Mashatile was being blocked by Ramaphosa and his close allies from becoming deputy president following David Mabuza‚Äôs resignation. Mabuza stepped down form his position and gave up his seat as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the National Assembly last month to make way for Mashatile, who was elected as ANC deputy president at the governing party‚Äôs 55th national elective conference in December. Ramaphosa confirmed Mashatile‚Äôs appointment in his Cabinet reshuffle this week. Addressing the media at a fundraising event in Bryanston, Johannesburg, on Wednesday, ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula said Ramaphosa had fulfilled his commitment to appoint Mashatile as the country‚Äôs second-in-command. ‚ÄúWe urge our members to move ahead post-conference and focus on the interests of people ‚Äì and not be misguided by unfounded rumours. [Paul] Mashatile is now the deputy president of the country. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs never been any intention from the president and any of us to stop him becoming deputy president. We have all learned about those conspiracies in the public domain and so on,‚Äù he said.

The president requested that he wants those comrades to form part of this energy driven reshuffle.‚Äù @MYANC Secretary General, Cde Fikile Mbalula, briefs the media following today‚Äôs ANCYL NYTT Fundraising Breakfast, in Bryanston, Johannesburg. https://t.co/eQMDftZStn pic.twitter.com/fueqFTcMW0‚Äî ANC SECRETARY GENERAL | Cde Mbalula (@MbalulaFikile) March 8, 2023 Mashatile was sworn in as South Africa‚Äôs ninth deputy president at Tuynhuys in Cape Town on Tuesday.
