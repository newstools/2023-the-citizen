Marumo Gallants attacker Celimpilo Ngema has become hot property and will probably not be with the Limpopo side next season.  ALSO READ: Mokwena: ‘We have no right to claim the league yet’ Ngema has been one of the better performers for Gallants since they bought Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila’s status three years ago.  It has been reported that he had signed a pre-contract with AmaZulu FC. But a source close to the 25-year-old says the player has not signed with Usuthu yet.  “His manager has a good relationship with AmaZulu and that is why when they showed interest, it was believed he had signed.  “What I know is that he is still considering options because other teams like Sekhukhune United and Royal AM are also interested,” said the source.  If he ends up at AmaZulu, he will reunite with coach Romain Folz whom he worked with at Gallants earlier this season.  “AmaZulu’s interest started when Folz said he wanted an experienced attacking player and he suggested the club to go for him (Ngema).  “But now that he has brought Pule Ekstein and Thabo Qalinge back into the team, he might not need Ngema anymore,” added the source.
