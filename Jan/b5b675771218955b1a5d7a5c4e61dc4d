The Bulls ended a three-match losing run in some style when they downed the Dragons 29-14 in a United Rugby Championship match in Newport on Friday night. The Bulls were under all sorts of pressure ahead of the game following a less than impressive festive period and the fact director of rugby Jake White and key flyhalf Chris Smith went down with the flu, preventing them from taking part in the match. But the Bulls, with their pack and dominant scrum laying the foundation, got back to winning ways with a good performance which brought them four tries. The Bulls were 17-0 up in no time, thanks to Kurt-Lee Arendse going in and a penalty try being awarded, but the home team fought back to close the gap to 17-14 at the break. White’s men though were the better of the sides and they managed to keep the Dragons out in the second half and score two more tries of their own, by Harold Vorster and Bismarck du Plessis. The bonus-point win will have brought much relief after the Bulls’ URC losses to the Stormers and Sharks over Christmas and New Year. The Bulls moved into third place on the log with the win. The Dragons’ two tries were scored by Bradley Roberts and Max Clarke.
