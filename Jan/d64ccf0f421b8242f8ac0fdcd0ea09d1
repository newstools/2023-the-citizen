I think it was obvious in the beginning of the game that we were the dominant side. The rhythm of the game, the transition, we found a way to manipulate the opponents the way we wanted. But we could not capitalize with the amount of entrances inside the box, in the final third and we got good chances,” said the Bucs mentor. “I think the first 30 minutes was totally for Pirates just before the score-line was 1-1 (against City). If I remember right we also had a chance to score in transition, but the decision making was not the best. They equalized, changed the set-up, they were also a bit better physically.” Following the two defeats, Pirates dropped down to 8th place with 19 points from 15 matches. The Soweto giants will be looking to bounce back to winning ways when they face Golden Arrows at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday.
