Miss Drag South Africa (MDSA) is a national pageant where beautiful and intelligent drag queens and transgender ladies from across the country put their best fashion foot forward to be crowned Miss Drag SA. Enigma Von Hamburg, Director of Miss Drag South Africa, said the pageant has positioned itself as a catalyst for change within the LGBTQA+ community and beyond. “Born out of the ethos of “Drag with a purpose”, MDSA has provided a platform where change agents are cultivated to engage in transformational work that is community orientated and community specific,” they added. The beauty pageant has been around since 2017, and the fifth queen will be crowned in Cape Town later this year.

Anyone who is/was assigned male at birth and who identify either as non-binary, gay and/or transgender and who is a lover of the art of drag can enter the beauty pageant. “We are aware that drag is not a gender identity but a form of expression that has later become an impetus for queer liberation,” Von Hamburg said. The beauty pageant’s debut event took place in 2017 in Stellenbosch, Western Cape where educator, Zilin Ayoki was crowned at the end of the night. Vinny Vicky took the crown in the second edition in 2018 in the windy city of Gqeberha. Tshwane hosted the pageant in 2019 where Belinda Qaqamba Ka-Fassie, a Masters Student in Education (Stellenbosch University) was crowned. The reigning queen, Miz Campbell is a designer and robotic expert, and will crown the new winner later this year in the Mother City. Entries close 15 February 2023.
