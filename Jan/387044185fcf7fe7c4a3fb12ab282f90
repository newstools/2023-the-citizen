City Power has continued with its aggressive three-day revenue collection operation to recoup millions from defaulting customers. Thursday was day three of the operation by the power utility in an effort to recover R363 million debt in Alexandra. City Power said it’s adopting a tough stance on defaulting customers and cutting off the power supply of businesses that refuse to pay for services. The utility said it also intends removing illegal connections of those who are found to have bypassed meters. Spokesperson Isaac Mangena said the targeted businesses were given pre-disconnection notices months ago but failed to make payment arrangements. He said customers included petrol stations, government institutions, manufacturing companies, government learning institutions and places of worship. “We haven’t quantified the amount that that we basically managed to recoup because as we go along, customers come to the depot to pay to basically make sure that accounts are in order. Some of them to pay the outstanding balances that they’ve been owing,” said Mangena. “This is very encouraging. It means when we started on Monday, people actually heeded our call.”  City Power is continuing within its aggressive 3-day revenue collection operation to recoup millions from defaulting customers in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg.   #CityPower @TheCitizen_News pic.twitter.com/r92O5hhsM7— ???????????????????????? ????????????????????

The garage was looted last year and all the electricity cables were taken out. We are going now to City Power to show them our bills and show them the payments that we’ve been making,” said Patel.
