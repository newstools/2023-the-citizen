According to the Gauteng education department, it registered 290 757 pupils for Grades 1 and 8 in the province on Wednesday, with 1 394 pupils not placed.  The department insists it will place all the remaining children over the next few days as the online admissions system admittedly is still not completely without its problems.

Even for all the Grade 1 pupils who were correctly placed at schools across the province, that’s where their long journey starts.
