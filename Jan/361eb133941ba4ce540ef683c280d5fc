Going hard from the start may be part of the mythology surrounding the England team at the moment, but they certainly finished powerfully as they posted a formidable 342/7 in the second ODI against South Africa in Bloemfontein on Sunday. Sent in to bat, it was a struggle early on for England as the Proteas bowled superbly and enjoyed considerable movement off the pitch as well as good bounce. The tourists could only post 42/2 in the first, 10-over powerplay, as the impressive Lungi Ngidi bowled Jason Roy (9) through the gate with a superb delivery and Wayne Parnell trapped Dawid Malan lbw for 12. England then slipped to 82/3 when Ben Duckett (20) holed out against spinner Keshav Maharaj. But the middle-order responded emphatically for England as they took control of proceedings. Harry Brook, playing in just his second ODI, having made a duck in his first, provided the impetus England wanted with a feisty 80 off just 75 balls. Jos Buttler then produced the captainâ€™s innings that he was not able to complete in the first ODI, batting through to the end of the innings and stroking a brilliant 94 not out off 82 deliveries. Buttler hit eight fours and three sixes and his partnership of 106 off 86 balls with Moeen Ali, whose hard-hit 51 came off just 45 deliveries, ensured England would get a good score.

Sam Curran then provided the blazing finish England wanted with 28 off just 17 balls. Left-armer Parnell (10-1-54-1) was the best of the South African bowlers, while Ngidi, who conceded just 28 runs in his first seven overs, unfortunately got hammered for 39 runs in his last two overs.
