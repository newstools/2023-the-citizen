The majority of people who died on Gauteng’s roads since 1 December 2022 were pedestrians, according to the Gauteng Traffic Police Department (GTPD). GTPD spokesperson Obed Sibasa, out of the 269 fatalities recorded between December 1 2022 and January 13 2023, more than half the number which is 144 is pedestrians. “This number might increase when the minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula pronounces the road crashes and fatalities for the festive season on Monday. “Gauteng road safety promotions warned pedestrians to refrain from unacceptable behaviour which include not to walk on and cross freeways but the tendency by pedestrians of trying to misjudge the speed of vehicles continued,” said Sibasa. Concerns were raised during the festive season about the behaviour of some road users which was once again blamed for some of the road crashes.

He said in recent days four pedestrians were killed in a space of five days on the N1-N12 between the Golden Highway and Lenasia. “The last recorded pedestrian vehicle fatal crash was on Friday at an area known for crashes between Waterworks and Golden Highway which has already recorded the highest number of crashes in the province,” Sibasa said. Meanwhile more than 3000 people were arrested for various traffic infringments. ALSO READ: Over 3000 arrested as hundreds die in festive road carnage
