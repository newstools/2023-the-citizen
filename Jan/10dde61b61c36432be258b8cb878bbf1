After years of being part of shows about polygamy, South Africa’s most popular polygamist Musa Mseleku has come to be known for his love for women. So it comes as no surprise that he piqued the interest of social media users when he joked about being mesmerised by recently widowed musician, Babes Wodumo.  He shared the joke with one of his wives, MaCele in a conversation they filmed and posted on his Instagram page as the pair tried to figure out whether or not the late Mampintsha called Mseleku a dog on his smash hit Ngeke.  According to a report by TshisaLive, many questioned whether Mampintsha says “Yinja’u Mseleku” (Mseleku is a dog) in the song at the part where he also sings “Ung’shooteleni, or Ung’jutheleni”. “He called you a dog while he was still alive. Now we can see why. You are a dog. You want Babes?” MaCele jokes in the video. She went on about how she believes Mampintsha could see how much of a “dog” the Uthando Nesthembu patriarch was while he was still alive.

The memorial was held just days after the musician died following a stroke on Christmas Eve.  He is survived by his wife, Babes Wodumo and their son, a boy nicknamed Sponge, and Babes Wodumo has been subject to much scrutiny for how she has been mourning in the wake of her husband’s death.
