South Africa’s first-choice and regular Proteas women’s captain Dané van Niekerk has failed a fitness test and will miss the national team’s T20 tri-series against India and the West Indies taking place in East London from January 19 to February 2. Van Niekerk missed a number of series, including the Commonwealth Games and the World Cup in New Zealand last year, because of an ankle injury, but returned to the game in December. Van Niekerk will have to improve her fitness though if she is to feature at the T20 World Cup in South Africa, starting on February 10. In a statement released by Cricket South Africa on Tuesday, the national body said Van Niekerk “had missed out on eligibility for selection following an unsuccessful bid to meet the national benchmark standards in the physical battery assessment.” The 17-member Proteas women’s team squad is also minus experienced wicket-keeper Trish Chetty, who is nursing a back injury. “Dané has progressed very well and it’s a step in the right direction,” said convenor of selectors Clinton du Preez. “Unfortunately, she did not meet the minimum national standards and therefore is ineligible for selection and we will continue working on her fitness as we continue through the tri-series, to assess her eligibility for the World Cup.” ALSO READ: SA cricket boss Nkwe: ‘New Proteas coaches will bring fresh energy’ Sune Luus will continue to captain the side, as she did in the absence of Van Niekerk last year.
