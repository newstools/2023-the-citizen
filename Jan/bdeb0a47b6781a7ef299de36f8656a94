The Lions received another injury blow this week, as their squad set off for Europe for their four week tour in the United Rugby Championship (URC) and Challenge Cup, without star scrumhalf Sanele Nohamba in the 29-man touring party. Since signing from the Sharks towards the end of last season, Nohamba has quickly established himself as the Lions starting number nine, ahead of the impressive Morne van den Berg and experienced Andre Warner.

He joins a long list of injured Lions starters that includes captain Reinhard Nothnagel, props Ruan Dreyer and Sti Sithole, eighthman Francke Horn, and wing Rabz Maxwane, who was also injured in the Stormers clash. Van Den Berg and Warner, who were the Lions first choice scrumhalves last season, will now have to pick up the baton in the absence of Nohamba, and it will be a big opportunity for them to stake a claim for a starting berth over the four week tour. The Lions did receive a bit of good news in the return of experienced loose forward Jaco Kriel and exciting rising midfield star Henco van Wyk, who were both unavailable for the Stormers game with injury niggles, but were passed fit to play. Blitzboks star JC Pretorius, who signed for the Lions in December, has also been named in the squad and will likely make is debut in the loose trio at some stage of the tour. After two poor losses against the Sharks and Bulls respectively in their festive fixtures, the Lions now face a daunting tour in which they somehow have to pick up a few good wins to get their season back on track. They will be looking to star youngsters like Jordan Hendrikse, Emmanuel Tshituka and Ruan Venter to try and spark something, while the more grizzled and experienced players like Willem Alberts and Andries Coetzee will need to try and guide the largely young squad as best they can.
