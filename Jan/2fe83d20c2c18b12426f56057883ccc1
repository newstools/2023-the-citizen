Marco Jansen slammed an incredible 66 runs off just 27 deliveries to power the Sunrisers Eastern Cape to an amazing come from behind two wicket win over the Mumbai Indians Cape Town in their SA20 clash at Newlands in Cape Town on Wednesday afternoon. Chasing 172 to win, the Sunrisers looked dead and buried after 15 overs, sitting on 105/6, with just their bowling all-rounders Jansen and Brydon Carse (5) at the crease.

The carnage started in MI CT captain Rashid Khan’s 16th over, with Jansen pulling him four a six, edging him for four, and then slog sweeping three more maximums in the over as 28 came off of it. The 17th over from Kagiso Rabada was going well with just four off the first four balls, but Jansen powered the fifth through mid-wicket for four and then flat batted a six off the last as 14 came off it. Rabada’s penultimate over also went for 14 as Jansen clubbed him for consecutive sixes, but the last ball of the over saw him bowled, but it left his side needing just four runs off the final over to win. Sam Curran bowled it and after Roelof van der Merwe (4no) hit a two and a single off the first two balls, a dot followed before Curran overstepped handing the Sunrisers the win in slightly anticlimactic fashion with a no ball. Earlier in the innings most of the Sunrisers top and middle order got starts but couldn’t kick on with Adam Rossington (11), Sarel Erwee (19), Aiden Markram (12), Tristan Stubbs (28) and Jordan Cox (13) all falling to leaven them in massive strife, before Jansen’s heroics. At the start of play the Sunrisers won the toss and chose to field, with MI CT scoring 171/6 in a rollercoaster of an innings. Sisanda Magala claimed the early wicket of Dewald Brevis (6) caught by Jon-Jon Smits at slip and should have had Grant Roelofsen in the same over, only for Smuts to shell him on nought. This allowed Roelfsen, 56 off 36 balls (7×4; 2×6), and Ryan Rickleton, 46 off 36 (4×4, 1×6) to set off on an impressive 102-run second wicket partnership that put them on course for a massive score. But Ottneil Baartman, 2/21, accounted for both in the same over, while Van Der Merwe, 2/21, also picked up a double in an over as MI CT tumbled to 123/6 in the 17th over. That left Delano Potgieter, 21no off 13 (1×4, 2×6) and Odean Smith, 25no off 13 (3×4, 1×6) to power them to a competitive total, that didn’t prove to be enough in the end.
