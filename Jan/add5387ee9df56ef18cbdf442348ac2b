Rally driver and YouTube sensation Ken Block has been pronounced dead after a snowmobile accident on Monday (2 January). Revered for his antics behind the wheel, that also led to short spell in the World Rally Championship driving a Ford Fiesta, as well as in the World Rallycross Championship behind the wheel of a Focus, the founder of Hoonigan instantly became an icon ever since the emergence of his Gymkhana clips in 2008. In a statement on its Facebook page, the Wasatch County Sheriff’s Office in the state of the Utah said the following: “On 2 January, 2023, at approximately 2.pm, the Wasatch County 911 Centre received a call reporting a snowmobile accident in the Mill Hollow area.

He was pronounced deceased at the scene from injuries sustained in the accident. “Mr Block was riding with a group but was alone when the accident occurred. The State Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the official cause of death.” Block’s Hoonigan brand has also released a statement of his passing on Instagram, describing him as a “pioneer, visionary, icon and most importantly, a father and husband”. The success of his Gymkhana antics and popularity resulted in a number of high profile media appearances mostly famously on Top Gear in 2009, accompanied by star presenter James May in which a purpose-built layout at California’s Inyokern Airport was used. Tributes have continued to pour in for Block, who leaves behind his wife, Lucy, and three children. A statement from the Block family is likely to be released at some stage with funeral details also expected. Addition info from motor1.com.
