Mere days before Prince Harry’s highly anticipated autobiography, Spare, is set to be released, a copy of the Duke of Sussex’s book was ‘obtained’ by British daily newspaper, The Guardian. Prince William, Prince Harry and their wives, Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle trended on social media on Thursday morning, as Tweeps shared their thoughts on the bombshells dropped in Spare. In the autobiography, Prince Harry recounts how he was physically attacked by his brother, Prince William, after the two of them got into a shouting match.   According to a report by The Guardian, Prince Harry wrote that the confrontation at his London home in 2019 ensued after his brother, now the Prince of Wales, called his wife, Meghan, “difficult, rude and abrasive”. Harsh words were exchanged between the two princes, including Prince Harry accusing Prince William of acting like the heir, unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare. After insults were thrown around between the two royal brothers, William reportedly told Harry that he was only trying to help, which Harry didn’t take well as he felt that what his brother was doing was not ‘helping’. Harry then goes on to describe how, after going to the kitchen to get his brother a glass of water to calm him, William grabbed him by his collar, ripping his necklace and knocking him to the floor, which resulted in him falling on the dog’s bowl with his back, which cracked, the pieces cutting into him. According to the report by The Guardian, this scene is only one of many Prince Harry describes in Spare. Prince Harry’s memoir will be published on 10 January 2023. The book will be published in 16 languages.

A risky pregnancy at that for she was over the age of 35. I hope karma comes for him. pic.twitter.com/jvkfYhKkeq— TV Fanatic????⚜️ (@TvKhaleesi) January 5, 2023 I stand by Prince William, whilst his brother makes money off selling stories to anyone who will pay him… Prince William remains dignified and doesn’t stoop so low. #PrinceWilliamIsAKing ???? pic.twitter.com/B76UF3fNDp— Kayla Adams (@KaylaAdams___) January 5, 2023 Before y’all start….Prince William’s temper isn’t new. His jealousy of Prince Harry isn’t new. pic.twitter.com/kd73ZAmbdQ— BLACKLIVESMATTER (@Jasamgurlie) January 5, 2023 Reminder that Prince William’s ‘friends’ gloated to a royal biographer a couple of years ago that William stormed round to confront Harry face to face after screaming at him over the phone and Harry hanging up on him. #PrinceWilliamIsABully— Anna (@Anna__with_an_A) January 5, 2023 Remember in the #HarryAndMeghanNetflix docuseries when Prince Harry revealed his signature was forged on a statement saying Prince William didn't bully him and Meghan out. It all makes sense now. These two fled domestic abuse. #PrinceWilliamIsABully #MeghanMarkle pic.twitter.com/lsstqStDEZ— Glow (@SussexRoyalGlow) January 5, 2023 Prince Harry called his therapist because his brother Prince William ripped his necklace and pushed him on to a dog bowl…… the same Prince Harry couldn’t get his wife a therapist when she said she was suicidal? He said on public tv that he was embarrassed to tell anyone?Wtf— Kayla Adams (@KaylaAdams___) January 5, 2023 So when Prince William said he had his arm around his brother all their lives, did he mean in a chokehold? pic.twitter.com/vpzPdlwAcS— Love, Lola (@LoveLolaHeart) January 5, 2023
