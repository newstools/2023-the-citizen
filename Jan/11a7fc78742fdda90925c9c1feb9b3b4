My friend Diets is not a legend. He is The Legend. To his family and friends, he is a combination of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell and Clark Kent, spiced up with elements of the Dalai Lama and Gordon Ramsay. Weird combination? No. He is beyond brave, a superhero, anchored in his religion, and he cancook with the best. The other day he treated us to the most exquisite curry, made with a whole leg of lamb and potatoes. As we were feasting, he recalled an urban legend from years gone by: a curry competition at the Pietermaritzburg agricultural show. Legend has it that one of the judges didn’t arrive and a British tourist, let’s call him Nigel, wasroped in as the third judge, with the promise of free beer. This is how the legendary curry tasting was scored: Seelan’s Maniac Tomato CurryJudge No 1 – An amusing kick.Judge No 2 – Very mild.Nigel: Holy S##t, took me two beers to put the flames out. Phoenix BBQ Chicken curryJudge No 1 – Slight chilli tang, with a hint of chicken.Judge No 2 – Needs more chillies.Nigel: Keep this out of reach of children. I definitely need another beer, quick.
