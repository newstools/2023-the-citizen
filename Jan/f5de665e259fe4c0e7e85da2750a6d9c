Eric Tinkler wants his Cape Town City players to build on the momentum from the Orlando Pirates game going into their clash against Chippa United at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Gqeberha on Saturday.

It is a tough stage of the season, the second round of the season. We need to try to climb up that league table and remain in the top-eight. That has been our objective and our purpose. Training this week has been good.”  City will be without his centre-back Keanu Cupido, who got injured when they played against Bucs. But, the City coach is glad to have former Kaizer Chiefs defender Lorenzo Gordinho back after serving his suspension.  “One or two niggles that we picked up from the game against Pirates, Keanu Cupido for example, is not available unfortunately. Gordinho comes back from his suspension, so he becomes available and we have choices available for us against Chippa.” The Mother City based club are in position eight on the league standings with 19 point, while Chippa sit in 10th spot on the log, with the same number of points as City.
