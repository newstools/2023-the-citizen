There seems to be a day for everything and on 16 January it is International Hot and Spicy Food Day. What better way to have your lips simmering with delicious heat than by making your own spicy hot wings? A popular meal during the day, people usually get their hot wings fix at their favourite fast food franchise.  For International Hot and Spicy Food Day, it is expected people will feast on the spiciest and hottest foods they love.  Hot wings are synonymous with Chicken Licken, KFC, restaurants and for making an appearance during an event or family gatherings.
