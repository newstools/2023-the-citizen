Despite abortions having been legal in South Africa since November 1996, it is estimated that between 52% and 58% of the estimated 260 000 abortions that take place in South Africa every year are illegal. According to the World Health Organization, around 7 million women are admitted to hospitals every year in developing countries as a result of unsafe abortions. On Monday, the Gauteng Department of Health warned women against the dangers and side effects of backstreet abortions. They urged women not to risk their lives with these “fly-by-night” abortions as they have many side effects including infections, severe blood loss and damage to the cervix which can prevent you from falling pregnant again.

A pregnancy between 13 and 20 weeks can only be terminated under specific conditions. An abortion past the 20-week mark of pregnancy is not allowed in South Africa unless either the mother or foetus’s life is in danger or if there are likely to be serious birth defects.
