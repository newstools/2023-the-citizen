Police in Mmametlhake, Mpumalanga, confiscated 26 goats that were being transported on a trailer on the back of a minibus. The driver said he had been hired to take the animals to an auction, but the police want the goats’ owners to identify them before they are released.  The goats, which had no branding, were confiscated at Kameelrivier B on Sunday. This comes after numerous incidents of stock theft have been reported in the province. Police seized the 26 goats when they spotted a white Toyota Quantum minibus pulling a trailer loaded with the animals. The driver of the Toyota Quantum said he was transporting the stock to an auction after being hired by the goat owners from four different households. The driver also told the police that the owners wanted to sell their stock because they were worried they would be stolen.  Police opened a docket and seized the goats as the driver could not provide any proof of ownership.
