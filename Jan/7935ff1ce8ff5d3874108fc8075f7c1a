The Lions have included fit-again Jordan Hendrikse at flyhalf for their Challenge Cup match against the Dragons in Newport on Sunday. Hendrikse has recovered from an ankle injury he picked up two weeks ago in the match against Munster in the United Rugby Championship. He takes the place of Gianni Lombard. Sunday’s is must-win match for Ivan van Rooyen and his troops as they aim to secure a top six finish in Pool B of the Challenge Cup ahead of the round of 16. Joining Hendrikse in the halfbacks is Andre Warner, who gets a chance ahead of Morne van den Berg. Elsewhere, hookers Michael van Vuuren and PJ Botha swap jersey numbers, with the former getting an opportunity in the starting XV. Forwards coach Albert van den Berg said the team would take confidence into the match as they had not lost to the Dragons in their last three encounters across all competitions. “If you look at our recent games, one of the things we can work on is limiting our unforced errors coupled with decision-making at crucial times,” said Van den Berg ahead of the game. “We tend to do a lot of playing but don’t get the points for it. So, if we can change that, then we increase our chances of a positive result. Dragons are a good side who’ve shown good improvement, so we need to be sharp come Sunday afternoon.”  Kick-off is 3pm Lions: Andries Coetzee, Quan Horn, Henco van Wyk, Marius Louw, Edwill van der Merwe, Jordan Hendrikse, Andre Warner, Emmanuel Tshituka, Emile van Heerden, Jaco Kriel, Darrien Landsberg, Willem Alberts, Asenathi Ntlabakanye, Michael van Vuuren, JP Smith. Bench: PJ Botha, Morgan Naude, Ruan Smith, Pieter Jansen van Vuren, Ruhan Straeuli, JC Pretorius, Morne van den Berg, Rynhardt Jonker
