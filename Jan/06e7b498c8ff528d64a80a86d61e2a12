There will be few people who will argue with the proposition that South Africa’s citizens are under enormous pressure because of our financial and societal problems – never mind individual mental health issues.  This manifests in increasing anger and increasing venting of that anger through violence and road rage, as well as a general collapse of basic human decency and manners.

Khoza says we should “bring back family values, bring back a loving spirit among each other, because we need each other at the end of the day”.  That is not a bad way to start, we think.
