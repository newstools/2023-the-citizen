They might already wish the first part of this year folds itself up into the tiniest of particles and just disappears.It must be nice being in love with Masandawana. Rulani Mokwena’s men are as reliable as Christmas itself, always bringing presents to their supporters in the form of three points, followed by another and another….you get the picture.Chiefs and Pirates, meanwhile, are more like Eskom – they turn your power on for a bit, only to quickly fall back into familiar darkness.
