Argentine Junior Mendieta created and scored the 50th-minute goal that put the home team ahead in a clash of sides at the wrong end of the standings midway through the season. Gallants moved above Maritzburg Untied on goal difference. Both teams having 14 points. Stellenbosch remained 13th, three points above the relegation zone. Apart from battling to avoid the drop, Marumo have six CAF Confederation Cup group matches to play between February 12 and April 2, including visits to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Algeria and Libya. “Conceding so late was a bitter pill to swallow,” said Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker, whose team are winless in seven matches. “Even after Marumo levelled, we had chances to score again.” Marumo coach Dan Malesela said he would not “hammer his boys” despite securing only point from a possible 12 since the league resumed in late December after World Cup and Christmas breaks. “Our work rate was high and we were the fitter side in the closing stages. What we have to cut out is the silly mistakes that lead to us conceding goals.” On Tuesday, defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns beat Chippa United more comfortably than the 2-1 scoreline suggests in Pretoria to build a 13-point lead at the top of the table. Back in action after a lengthy injury absence, Namibian Peter Shalulile came off the bench in the second half to score for Sundowns in a match where all the goals came from headers.
