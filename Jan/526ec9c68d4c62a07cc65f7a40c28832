The thrill and excitement around South Africa’s latest Twenty 20 competition, the SA20, got a fresh new boost on Tuesday when Betway announced they were doubling the prize money for clean one-handed catches off a six. With the competition now in full swing and fans packing out stadiums, Betway have doubled the prize money from R1-million to R2-million for catches taking by the fans. Fans over the age of 18 who take a clean one-handed catch at any SA20 game will win a share of R2-million up for grabs. Fans who are Betway account holders will have their winnings doubled. The competition is now a week old, with fans flocking to the grounds. Joburg’s Wanderers Stadium will host their first game on Tuesday evening when the Joburg Super Kings take on neighbours, the Pretoria Capitals, starting at 5.30pm. In the earlier game on Tuesday, at 1.30pm, Paarl Royals take on Durban’s Super Giants.
