South Africa’s favourite Springbok wife took a very brave step on Tuesday when she decided to chop off her long, golden locks in favour of a shorter hairstyle.   The mom and co-founder of the Kolisi Foundation said that it has been 18 years since she has cut her hair so short, adding that she is not a big fan of change. But, with a New Year just having started and the Kolisi Family moving to France later this year, it looks like Rachel has decided to embrace the change. A little pampering was definitely in order as Rachel moved “3 kids, 2 dogs and 6 379 bags to Durban” just four weeks ago to join her husband, Springbok captain Siya Kolisi, who is currently plays for the Sharks. Fans and followers flocked to the comments section on Rachel’s post to complement her on her beautiful new hairstyle. Fellow ‘rugby wives’ Anlia van Rensburg, Springbok lock, Eben Etzebeth’s fiancée and Marise Pollard, Springbok fly-half Handré Pollard’s wife exclaimed how much they loved this new look.

Other fans and followers expressed how much they loved her new shorter hair style, saying that it looks chic. Rachel’s bags were barely unpacked when Siya announced on 3 January that he will be joining French Rugby Union Club, Racing 92, after the 2023 Rugby World Cup. This move means that Rachel and the kids will move for a third time to join him in Paris where the club is situated. In a statement released after news of his move was announced, Siya said that Rachel and the kids have sacrificed so much throughout his career and that he is immeasurably grateful for this. He added that the move will, however, enable him to spend more time with his family, which is something he has longed for and which also played a big role in his decision to join the French rugby club.
