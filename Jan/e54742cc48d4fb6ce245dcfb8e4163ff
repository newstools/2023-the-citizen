The suspects, aged of 43 and 44, will appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Thursday and face charges of possession and selling of elephant tusks. The arrests come after the Hawks were tipped off about the suspects wanting to sell the tusks. “The Hawks set up a trap for the suspects on Wednesday, 18 January 2023, and arranged to buy the elephant tusks from the suspects,” said police spokesperson Captain Christopher Singo.
