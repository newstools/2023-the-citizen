Former Proteas spinner and current Joburg Super Kings star Aaron Phangiso has been reported for a suspect bowling action. The 38-year-old left-arm spinner, who’s played ODI and T20 cricket for the Proteas, was a wildcard pick for the Super Kings in the on-going SA20 league.  The SA20 competition received an official “suspected illegal bowling action” report from the match officials team that handled the match between the Joburg Super Kings and Pretoria Capitals on Tuesday at the Wanderers. The Super Kings won their first home game, with Phangiso taking 4/32. The matter will now be handed over to the independent Bowling Action Panel for adjudication. The panel consists of match referee representative Gerrie Pienaar, former Proteas bowler Vernon Philander and Cricket South Africa high performance manager Vincent Barnes. The panel has seven days to review video footage from the match and reach a conclusion. Phangiso may continue to play while the matter is being reviewed.
