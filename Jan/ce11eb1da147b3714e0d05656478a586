Dar es Salaam. Tanzania’s top professional boxer Karim “Mtu Kazi” Mandonga has been offered a bout in England after achieving a technical knockout (TKO) in the sixth round against Kenyan Daniel Wanyonyi. Kenyan Wanyonyi elected not to finish the fight in the sixth round, which resulted in Mandonga being proclaimed the winner. Mandonga dominated from the outset and won the fight via knockout (KO) in the early rounds. “I am overjoyed to have won the fight. I told my opponent that I am a powerful boxer with a variety of tactics. I had to knock him out early because I wanted the professional boxing fans who paid their fees to enjoy the game and get their money’s worth,” stated Mandonga. Juma Ndambile, a representative for Mandonga, informed The Citizen that they will inform professional boxing fans and stakeholders when Mandonga will fight in England. “In addition to England, Mandonga has been promised fights in Mozambique and Mauritius. After we receive the offer, we will decide where to fight. Essentially, Mandonga has improved his reputation and deserves to receive the best package in his fight. “Mandonga started getting paid nicely in the fight against Shaaban Kaoneka despite his loss and afterwards against Saidi Mbelwa and won,” stated Ndambile. Mandonga has refined his fighting skills since his bout against Saidi Mbelwa in November of last year. Earlier, Mandonga lost two consecutive fights and his name was used to describe any person who is a “loser”. However, Mandonga was not dispirited with the situation and continue to brand himself in the game and is regarded one of the prominent boxer.
