Former Miss SA contestant Tamsyn Jack is now Tamsyn Gerrits after getting married to her partner Jaco. She shared some snaps from their wedding while enjoying an idyllic honeymoon with her husband in The Maldives.  The pair got married at Maison Franschoek where he wore a forest green suit by Frank Bespoke and she wore a gorgeous off-the-shoulder dress with a plunging neckline by Rosa Karoo Bridal.  The column-shaped dress also featured a beaded and jewelled motif across the front.  After saying “I do”, Tamsyn and Jaco jetted off to The Maldives in early December, and stayed at the picturesque Kandima resort.  Their holiday was the epitome of “sun, sea and sand” as they enjoyed water sports, days at the beach and evenings dining on Maldivian cuisine.  ALSO READ: Miss SA Ndavi Nokeri prepares for Miss Universe When the bombshell wasn’t stunning her followers in a selection of simple but beautiful dresses, she showed off her phenomenal body in a range of bikinis.  Tamsyn Jack is a model hailing from Somerset West in the Western Cape.  According to an article by The Weekend Argus, the 26-year-old holds a degree in food science from Stellenbosch University and she is the brains behind Pique Digital, a paid media agency and the director of property company, Urban Trend Group.
