It is an encounter that he is expecting to be very difficult, but Stellenbosch FC coach Steve Barker wants his charges to raise  the bar when they visit Orlando Pirates in a DStv Premiership match at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday.

The last time the clubs met it ended in a 1-1 draw, but Barker reckons they should have gotten more from the game. “I am expecting a very closely fought match. Generally, when we meet Orlando Pirates, the games have been very tight, even in the reverse fixtures earlier this season which I felt we probably deserved more from,” said Barker.  “Pirates are obviously a tough team away from home, and at their home ground and they are coming off a good win.” “But it is an exciting encounter on the cards. We’ve got to go there and find a way to defend well because they are a good attacking team and they move the ball very well. They have a lot of good, quality individuals all-round the pitch, so we have to find ways to negate that threat.” Going into this clash, Barker hasinjuries to some of his regular players, but he believes it gives other players a chance to showcase what they can do for the club. “Unfortunately we have injuries to players such as Fawaaz Bassadien, Vusi Sibiya, Lasse Sobiech and Juan Ortiz, who is still coming back from a long term ACL injury. But it’s part of the game. It is a bit of a blow for us to lose some players who have been regulars in the team this season, however it always provides an opportunity to other players.” Stellenbosch have not been at their best this season and the Mother City based outfit are lying towards the bottom of the league standings, occupying 13th spot with only 17 points registered.
