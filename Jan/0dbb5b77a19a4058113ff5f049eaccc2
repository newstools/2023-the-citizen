If Lehlohonolo Majoro had his own way, he would want Kaizer Chiefs to come into their game against AmaZulu FC with their heads filled with ‘big name club’ mentality.  ALSO READ: Give my players more credit, pleads Sundowns coach Mokwena He believes this would make them vulnerable as they would think they have an upper hand over the lowly yet historical Usuthu side.  Majoro is himself a former Amakhosi player having turned out for the Naturena side who signed him from Usuthu where he began his career. Usuthu meet Chiefs in a DStv Premiership match at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night and both are looking for redemption.  The Durban based side lost to neighbours Royal AM last weekend while Amakhosi also lost to Sekhukhune United.   “I believe that with them being referred to as a big club in South Africa, they might believe that they have an upper hand,” said Majoro this week in the build up to the game. “But with us knowing that we have proven to be a formidable force in this league, we have another opportunity to emulate what we did in the previous seasons. “Who knows? It might be the start of our winning streak, more especially when we enter these last 15 games of the season,” added Majoro.  It will indeed be Amakhosi who will feel they have an upper hand in this clash as they have almost always managed to beat Usuthu in Durban.  And since Romain Folz joined Usuthu, the team has struggled to find rhythm. However, the occasion of playing Chiefs may just be the kick AmaZulu need.  Chiefs midfielder Yusuf Maart says they are looking to turn things around against Usuthu after the unexpected loss to Sekhukhune last weekend.  “We worked very hard during the December break and it showed in our first two games back,” he told the club’s website.  “Unfortunately, it didn’t go our way in the last game, but we are very keen to make that right against AmaZulu.”
