There is an element of fun and unknown when making a viral recipe, especially if the dish is just from two main ingredients and made within 20 minutes such as two ingredient cheesy potato bread.  This two ingredient cheesy potato bread went viral on TikTok last year, and has thousands of recreations from content creators and foodies alike.  This recipe has over a 1.2million views on a Tiktok account Cook Vegetarian, however, most people weren’t too happy to find out the two-ingredient cheesy potato bread recipe actually consisted of five to seven ingredients.  The technicality is from the bread, the dough only has two ingredients. A tip is to make ahead the potatoes and make sure the potatoes are cooked and mashed, it doesn’t necessarily have to be cooled.  Either way, most of these ingredients are pantry friendly and the recipe is simple to make.  Makes 2 ALSO TRY: Recipe of the day: Creamy one pan garlic shrimp with naan bread This recipe can be found on the Cook Vegetarian’s Instagram page.
