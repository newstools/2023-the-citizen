Kaizer Chiefs will celebrate their 53rd birthday on Saturday and will hope they can do it with another victory, after starting 2023 in some style. ALSO READ: Pirates offered huge money for Ndah Amakhosi picked up a 2-0 victory at Golden Arrows on Saturday, to give them hope as they look to mount a DStv Premiership title challenge following the lengthy break for the Fifa World Cup finals. Still plenty of points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns, Chiefs will have to keep pushing, and their next chance comes on Saturday against Sekhukhune United. One definite plus for Amakhosi is the form of Itumeleng Khune, who won his place back in goal and was excellent against Arrows. “They (Arrows) also had chances and Itu was at is best today. He led by example and his experience counts a lot. He gives the boys courage and belief. It was very satisfying to keep a clean sheet. We want to build on this now and keep the momentum going to keep more clean sheets,” said Chiefs head coach Arthur Zwane after the win over Arrows, according to the official Amakhosi website. Caleb Bimenyimana got one of the goals for Chiefs against Arrows, the Burundi striker’s 7th league goal of the season in just seven appearances. Edmilson Dove also got on the scoresheet but Zwane was not entirely happy with his attack. “We’ll go back to the drawing board and see where we can do better at capitalising on our opportunities and score more goals, because we are making the chances.” added Zwane. “It is a game of numbers and if we had scored a third we would be in a better position, because these things can count come the end of the season. “We need to be more clinical in front of goal, but we are working hard at that.” “We still have a lot of things to work on and improve but I am aware we have just come back from a very long recess, which is unusual for this time of the season, but I like the way we responded and I’m pleased we did not concede a goal,” he also said.
