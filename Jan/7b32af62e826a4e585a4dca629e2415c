Mwanza. The Tanzania Shipping Agencies Corporation (TASAC) has started collecting opinions from stakeholders in marine transport about the fares to be charged by a fast ferry services investor. The MV Rafiki 2 fast ferries, which will be transporting passengers between Mwanza and Bukoba on Lake Victoria, are expected to commence operations soon. The marine vessel, owned by a Mwanza-based private company, Songoro Marines, has the capacity to ferry 328 passengers and takes an average of four hours to ply between the two destinations. Fares charged during trial trips ranged between Sh30,000 and Sh60,000 for adults, while children and people with disabilities were charged Sh17,500 and Sh30,000. According to the fare chart seen by The Citizen, passengers wishing to travel in the economy class would be required to pay Sh35,000 for adults and Sh17, 500 for children and Sh30,000 for people with disabilities per trip. Adults’ fare in the business class is Sh50,000, Sh40,000 for children and Sh22,500 for people with disabilities. Adult passengers wishing to travel in the first class will be supposed to pay Sh60,000, while Sh50,000 and Sh30,000 are respectively charged to people with disabilities and children. Following citizens’ requests for fares to be reduced in order to benefit the majority, Tasac has started receiving opinions from stakeholders in Mwanza and Kagera regions. Citizens have been mobilised to appear for opinion provision between January 5 and January 13, 2023. Tasac’s economic control director, Nahson Sigalla, said opinions could be submitted verbally during the public hearing, in writing and through the corporation’s website. “Stakeholders’ opinions will enable the government, through the responsible authority, to issue indicative prices for the fast ferries expected to ply on Lake Victoria,” he said. A stakeholder from the Tanzania Energy Commission (Taec), Mr Baraka Kajubu, suggested that fares should consider citizens economic situation. According to him, fares shouldn’t broadly differ from those charged by publicly owned vessels and upcountry buses. On average the New MV Victoria, which is owned by the government through the Marine Services Company Limited (MSCL), charges an average of Sh22,000 and Sh50,000 for adults, depending on the class, while buses plying between the two destinations charge Sh25,000 per trip. Songoro Marines Company director Major Songoro said fares charged during the interim period considered operational costs that would enable them to make profits and be sustainable.
