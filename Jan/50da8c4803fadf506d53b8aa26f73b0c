Shukri Conrad has been named the Proteas’ new Test coach while Rob Walter will take charge of the white-ball teams. Cricket South Africa made the announcement in Joburg on Monday morning. Conrad is a former Lions and Cobras coach in South Africa, winning four trophies between the teams, and most recently was involved in guiding the SA U-19 team. Walter is a former Proteas strength and conditioning coach and later took up the position of Titans head coach.  He has also coached in New Zealand and been involved with the Indian Premier League teams Pune Warriors and Delhi Daredevils. The other candidates in the running were current stand-in coach Malibongwe Maketa, Adrian Birrell and Richard Pybus.

The positions became vacant after Mark Boucher stepped down from his role after the T20 World Cup. It is the first time since the end of 2012 when Russell Domingo coached the T20 side and Gary Kirsten was in charge of Tests and ODIs that Cricket South Africa have split the national coaching role. The Proteas T20 team crashed out to the lowly Netherlands at the T20 World Cup late last year when it looked like they were on course to feature in the knockout rounds, while the Test side were beaten 2-0 by Australia in a recent three-match Test series Down Under.
