Dar es Salaam. The ride-hailing company Uber has introduced a new safety check-up technology to give passengers and drivers more assurance during their trips According to the company, research showed that many riders were unaware of the safety features available to them. The new safety check-up will encourage riders to utilize features such as trusted contacts, PIN verification, and ride-check. Uber was forced to suspend services in Tanzania due to government regulatory changes that were enforced in April 2022. The company's head of East Africa, Imran Manji, announced that Uber has invested over $10 million in Tanzania and plans to continue investing in the market. He added that the company's new features allow passengers to register the names of five friends who will be notified every time the passenger takes a ride and also share the trip live. Another security feature is that if a trip stops suddenly due to a small accident or any breakdown, the report will be shared with the company and help will be asked for, which helps to increase the trust of both the customer and the driver. He also said, "We are excited to kick off the year on such a positive note by re-entering the Tanzanian market. We commend the government for their show of support for the growth and development of the ride-hailing industry. It is our priority to provide a platform where drivers can make substantial earnings while providing convenient and reliable options for riders in Tanzania." On the other hand, a driver named Elias Mwanga said, "I am an employee somewhere, but I also do this business. When this company left, it was a challenge because it had a large number of customers, so the business was somewhat unstable." He said the return of the company will provide an opportunity for young people to be self-employed because the need for ride hailing is currently great and people trust it due to comfort.
