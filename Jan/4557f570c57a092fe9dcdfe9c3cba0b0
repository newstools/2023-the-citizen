Four suspects believed to be responsible for a shooting incident that took place in Westbury, west of Johannesburg, on New Year’s Eve have been arrested. The suspects, who are suspected to be involved in gangsterism, were nabbed on Thursday in the area in connection with a shooting on 31 December 2022.  There were no injuries or fatalities related to the shooting incident, according to Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo.

He said police received information that the suspects were driving around Westbury, and members from Anti-Gang Unit, Sophiatown Crime Prevention Unit and Sophiatown Robbery Reaction Unit kept a close observation on them. “The vehicle driven by the suspects was spotted at the corner of Fuel and Kretzmar roads and it was stopped. “It was established that the car was reported stolen in Ennerdale last year December. The suspects led the police to a block of flats in Coronationville where two more suspects were arrested and a firearm with a magazine loaded with 12 live ammunition and drugs were recovered,” said Masondo in a statement on Friday. He said further investigations led police to the recovery of another firearm with two extended magazines at Fuzier Flats, in Newclare. All four suspects were arrested and charged with possession of a suspected stolen vehicle, possession of an unlicensed firearm, possession of ammunition and possession of drugs. Masondo did not rule out the possibility of more charges being added as the suspects are believed to be involved in gangsterism that is rife in Westbury and Eldorado Park. The suspects are expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday. IN PICTURES: Westbury community fights back against gang violence
