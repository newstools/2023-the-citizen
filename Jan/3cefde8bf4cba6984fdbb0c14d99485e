Four suspects who allegedly gang raped a 26-year-old woman with a mental disability were denied bail at the Nigel Magistrate’s Court in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, on Tuesday. The incident took place on the 22 December 2022 in Duduza, where Mathenjie Maya was kidnapped while walking on the street. She was taken to an abandoned house where the four men took turns in raping her throughout the night. The four suspects are all facing charges of rape. They also have previous charges which include rape and burglary. The suspects were denied bail because the investigation is ongoing and there is a risk they could pose a danger to the victim.
