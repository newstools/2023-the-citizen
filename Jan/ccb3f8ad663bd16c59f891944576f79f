The only surprises in the announcement of the final field for the World Sports Betting Cape Town Met came among the jockey bookings. The 19 horses named were entirely as expected. Met defending champion Kommetdieding will be among the favourites for the Cape’s biggest horse race at Kenilworth on January 28, as will his great rival Jet Dark.

But jockey Bernard Fayd’Herbe, much-lauded winner of the recent L’Ormarins King’s Plate on rank outsider Al Muthana, has jumped ship and will partner eight-year-old warhorse Do It Again for Justin Snaith. Speaking of warhorses, veteran Piere “Striker” Strydom takes over the Al Muthana duties for trainer Ricky Maingard. In itself, that’s a bit of a surprise as Strydom forsakes Nexus – on whom he has done very well lately – for a horse that might be challenged by the Met’s 2000m. Muzi Yeni is on Nexus, who ran a cracker in the 1800m Grade 2 Premier Trophy under Strydom. Another new partnership is current leading jockey Keagan de Melo and three-year-old sensation Make It Snappy – though this is entirely a weight-related issue. Luyolo Mxothwa, who steered Brett Crawford’s star filly to three of her four recent victories – including two Grade 1s – can’t make the 51.5kg the beautifully bred daughter of Dynasty has been allotted. Mxothwa gets the nod for Crawford stablemate Zapatillas. International superstar Christophe Soumillon is clearly enjoying a sojourn in the Cape and extends it to ride joint-topweight Golden Ducat for Eric Sands – and gets pole position in the draw. One further minor surprise is that top-level four-year-old Waterberry Lane has been entered by Maingard – giving him two runners – having moved from the Dean Kannemeyer yard.
