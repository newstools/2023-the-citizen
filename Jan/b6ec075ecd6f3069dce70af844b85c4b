Orlando Pirates coach Jose Riveiro says his technical team is filled with people who put in a lot of work  to ensure that the club is competitive. ALSO READ: Riveiro says competition for places is tough at Pirates Riveiro’s Pirates managed to get their first win of the year this weekend, with the side fighting all the way against Golden Arrows to score two late goals in the DStv Premiership tie and win the match 3-1 at the Orlando Stadium, with strikes from Monnapule Saleng, Terrence Dzvukamanja and Vincent Pule. The Buccaneers had been registering poor results prior to the Arrows clash and Riveiro says he and his team are always speaking about the club’s progress, to make sure they always at their best.   “There are a lot of eyes following and monitoring us. We are a team that cannot have a break. We speak about performance and improvement. And because there are good competitors, one of the things we do during the week in every exercise is to ensure that we compete to our best of abilities,” said the Bucs mentor.  “Everyone who’s behind me at this club is generally competitive. It’s people who don’t sleep when we don’t win.” Riveiro added that he finds it hard to eat when results aren’t going his team’s way.  “If I don’t win, I won’t have dinner, sleep or even breakfast. It’s too much at times. It’s the same for players although you think they don’t care. They suffer. Today (last Saturday), it meant that they had to finish with three points. And they did what they were supposed to do until the end and be braver.” The victory against Arrows saw Bucs climb to fifth place on the league standings from eighth spot. The Soweto giants have now collected 22points in their last 16 league games.
