The former SuperSport United and Sundowns striker lauded the attitude shown by the players, even after scoring, as they looked hungry to score more goals in the match against a Stellenbosch side that has been really poor this season. “I think it was a great performance. I am happy to get a goal and contribute to the three points, it was a great team performance, a great attitude after the first goal. It was a bit disappointing to concede, but I think scoring four goals…you can’t ask for anything better,” said Erasmus. The Pirates striker also showed gratitude to the Bucs supporters, and said as a team, they always appreciate the love they get from the Ghost. “We always appreciate the love they show us in the field. They are always spurring us on as a 12th man … we will give our best performances every day and enjoy with the Happy People,” Erasmus added. Meanwhile, Erasmus’ teammate Thabang Monare believes the performance could have been better for Bucs, but says they are happy that they managed to win the game. “It is always great to win, especially when you are playing at home. And I think we also can’t forget that there is always room for improvement. I think we could have had a better game than we did, taking nothing away from the result. But I think we always have to look at it that way as a team, that there are always ways where we can do better,” said Monare.
