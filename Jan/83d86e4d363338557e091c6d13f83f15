BEST BET RACE 2: NO 2 KARANGETANG – WIN This was a top two-year-old and last time was beaten by a top horse. Looks set to go one better this time. VALUE BET RACE 8: NO 9 BACK TO BASICS – EACHWAY This gelding came back from a break last time and ran a cracker to finish a close-up third in a stronger field than this over this course and distance. The draw is a slight concern but Back to Basics is expected to contest the finish.
