The 26-year-old goal-minder reveals that he didn’t know that Usuthu were interested in his services, but he sees the move as a good opportunity for him to compete for the starting line-up. “It was a surprise to be honest. I didn’t know that AmaZulu were interested in me. When they came last week I was happy for the opportunity. It is not a fresh start, but a chance for me to compete,” said the shot-stopper. The goalkeeper feels positive about joining AmaZulu and adds that he is looking forward to helping the team achieve their goals while looking to make more friendships. “The players were welcoming, I knew some of them and as times goes on I will get to know more and create more friendships, brotherhood and on and off the field we are on one. At the end of the day it is to help the club get better and better, reach the goals we have set for ourselves this season and hopefully we can all do that together.”ALSO READ: Chicken Inn clear air on Chiefs transfer ban saga February was signed by Sundowns in 2019 from Ajax Cape Town (now known as Cape Town Spurs).
