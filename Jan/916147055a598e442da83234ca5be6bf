BEST BET RACE 1: SWINGER/EXACTA: 4-MINSTREL GALLERY AND 11-EXECUTOR Minstrel Gallery had her first run for Gavin Smith in Port Elizabeth last time and ran an excellent second while beautifully bred Executor goes 1600m after two excellent sprints. These two should fight this out. The safe bet is the Swinger but one can also take Exactas boxed with the pair. VALUE BET RACE 5 QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT  1-NAVAL SECRET AND 3-LIFE ON MARS WITH THE FIELD Only seven horses are carded to go to post but any of them could win. The two floating bankers have consistent form over the course and distance and will be ridden by in-form Louie Mxothwa and S’manga Khumalo respectively. The full cost of the bet is R240 but one can, of course, take a percentage.
