Scrumhalf Imad Khan is set to make his Stormers debut, while wing Angelo Davids and hooker JJ Kotze also come onto the replacements bench in the only other changes to the matchday squad, as Dobson opts for continuity. Dobson said that the team is looking forward to what should be a completely different challenge to what they have faced in home conditions recently. “This is going to take a significant adjustment on a number of fronts for our team and this challenge comes at a crucial point in our season,” said Dobson on Friday. “We have seen some good growth from a lot of these combinations in recent weeks and would like to see if they can step-up while outside of their comfort zone. “While we haven’t been here long as it took a while to travel, our focus is on taking the next step as a group in these sorts of conditions.” ALSO READ: Tough January awaits Stormers on all fronts Stormers: Clayton Blommetjies, Suleiman Hartzenberg, Dan du Plessis, Damian Willemse, Leolin Zas, Manie Libbok, Paul de Wet, Hacjivah Dayimani, Willie Engelbrecht, Deon Fourie, Marvin Orie, Ben-Jason Dixon, Neethling Fouche, Joseph Dweba, Steven Kitshoff (capt).
