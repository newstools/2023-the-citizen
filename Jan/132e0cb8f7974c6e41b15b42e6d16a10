Eating healthy to lose weight doesn’t have to be tasteless. There are many flavourful dishes you can make and still lose weight at the same time. To help you with your weight-loss goals, we picked three of our favourite Mediterranean dishes to kick-start your Mediterranean diet.   The Mediterranean diet is really simple, and is based on the traditional cuisines of Greece, Italy and other countries that border the Mediterranean Sea. According to Mayo Clinic, plant-based foods such as wholegrains, legumes, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices form the foundation of this eating plan.
