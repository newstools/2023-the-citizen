But, his contribution to the team and having got a lot of minutes under his bely, has the club’s technical team and the management wanting to keep him longer at the club. His exit at Pirates shocked many when he was announced as one of the players who will be leaving, but Bucs changed their mind after some time to bring him back to the club. “Everything falls into place at some point, we were all shocked when we heard that he is leaving the club. He was also surprised because he didn’t see it coming. I wish you could have seen him when he got the call to tell him that they wanted to see him last year,” the source revealed.
