AmaZulu FC coach Romain Folz wants his side to go all out for the victory against Royal AM in a KwaZulu-Natal derby at the Chatsworth Stadium on Sunday. ALSO READ: New Pirates striking coach feels welcomed by the club Folz says it is important for his AmaZulu charges to get maximum points in order to move closer to where they want to be in the DStv Premiership table – the club are currently sitting in seventh place on the log with 18 points. “We have three points to get … no matter what. This game is important to us in a sense that it will get us in a good spot (on the log) closer to where we aim to be. So, we will try to make sure we secure that for us and our fans,” said the Usuthu coach. The AmaZulu mentor is also happy with some of the improvements he has seen from his players, especially physically. He says his charges showed it during their goalless draw against Sekhukhune United, where they ended up one player down following a red card for Ethan Brooks. “Before the break, I said one of our major improvements I want to see is the physical aspect. To do physical preparation you need about seven to eight weeks, we are in the middle of week six and you could see the improvement if you watched the game against Sekhukhune United,” he added. “We played 30 minutes with one man down, but we didn’t have any trouble physically. We were very intense and dynamic from the start to the finish. So, there is obviously big improvement in that area, but we can still get to a higher level of physicality and fitness. When it comes to tactical and technical aspects, there is a lot of work that we have been doing and I think we are going to be able to showcase it this weekend and in the games to come.” Royal AM will also be eager to get all three points against their rivals, with Thwihli Thwahla in ninth place on the table with 17 points.
