Centre Marius Louw will continue to lead the side in the absence of the injured Reinhard Nothnagel.  “Friday will be a good test for our guys against Munster,” said scrum coach Julian Redelinghuys.  “The Munster pack has been in good form recently, so Friday will be an exciting challenge for this team, especially the guys who’ll be getting an opportunity to feature. “We all know you don’t grow when it’s easy, you grow when it’s tough and Friday will be tough especially in these conditions away from home.” Playing at Musgrave Park in Cork will be a new experience for every Lions player, which will make thee challenge just a little more daunting. “None of our current squad members have played there. In saying that, we tend to strive under the new and unknown so this will certainly be one of those,” said Redelinghuys. Kick-off is at 9.35pm Friday. Lions: Quan Horn, Stean Pienaar, Henco van Wyk, Mariuss Louw, Edwill van der Merwe, Jordan Hendrickse, Morne van den Berg, Emmanuel Tshituka, Emile van Heerden, Jarod Cairns, Darrien Landsberg, Ruan Venter, Asenathi Ntlabakanye, PJ Botha, JP Smith.
