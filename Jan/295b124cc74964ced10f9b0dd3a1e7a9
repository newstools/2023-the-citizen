AmaZulu FC are set to fire coach Romain Folz a few months after the 32-year-old was installed as Brandon Truter’s replacement at the Durban side.

Phakaaathi has learnt that the club’s management were unhappy with his team selection and set-up but decided to give him a chance. “He has now had a ‘pre-season’ but things are not looking like they are changing for the better,” said a source. “It is not that the team has not won, but the way they play is not convincing and I would not be surprised if he is relieved of his duties soon.” Another source suggested that Folz may not be fired but re-deployed elsewhere in the club as rumours mount that they may be taking Manqoba Mngqithi on board.
