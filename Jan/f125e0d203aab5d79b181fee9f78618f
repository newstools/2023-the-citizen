Newly appointed ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula says people who believe that South Africa was better during the apartheid regime should be rejected. Mbalula addressed the media on Friday, on the the outcomes of the ANC’s 55th conference. The party’s conference took place in December at the Nasrec Expo Centre and was concluded virtually this year.

The national conference asserted that  the democratic gains made over the last three decades of freedom should be highlighted, consolidated and defended.” “The narrative by conservative and the neo-liberal forces of our country that suggest that life was better under apartheid and colonialism must be rejected by all freedom loving democratic minded people in our country and in the world.” “The newly elected NEC will urgently address the shortcomings, setbacks and reversals that threaten to undermine these gains.  “It is concerning that our mission to create a non-racial and non-sexist society has been undermined by the neoliberal forces in SA. The conference condemned in the strongest terms possible the harassment and discrimination against black people who regularly get attacked for the colour of their skin,” said Mbalula.   ALSO READ: All systems go for ANC conference, January 8 Statement celebrations – Mbalula
