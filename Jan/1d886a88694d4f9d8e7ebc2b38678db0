Despite being one of the most iconic automotive brands in the world, a new survey is unlikely to find any favours among Land Rover buyers for naming them as having the lowest IQ rating in the United Kingdom based on their choice of vehicle brand. While likely to raise a few eyebrows, the findings by Scrap Car Comparison based on a standard IQ test of 2 000 participants ranked the Best4x4xFar marque last with a score of 88.58. It was followed by the Fiat, with a buyer IQ of 90.14, followed by BMW (91.68), Volkswagen (92.25) and Volvo (92.40). Also, out of the top-ten of the 22 brands canvassed were Ford (92.75), Honda (92.88), Kia (93.01), Audi (93.25), Renault (93.41), Hyundai (93.25) and Citroën (94.29). On the other side of the coin, Volkswagen-owned Skoda was found to have the UK’s smartest drivers with an average score of 99. Second went to Suzuki on 98.09, with Peugeot finishing third (97.79), Mini fourth (97.41) and Mazda fifth (95.91). ALSO READ: Lower vehicle depreciation?
