Former Benoni bombshell turned Hollywood sensation Charlize Theron had netizens wondering if all was okay with the actress after she posted a video on the toilet. Theron posted the bizarre video on TikTok two days ago and has racked up over 1.5 million views. Concerned fans have since flooded the actress’ timeline hoping for an explanation. The video shows Theron sporting doek, stating the obvious, not once but a few times, before accidentally knocking a can of air freshener off the toilet. “Omg, what happened to her?” asked user Lily Bean, while others have tagged local DJs calling Theron’s potty song to be remixed. “@thekiffness, this needs you!!!! Your country needs you!!!!” posted Kerryn Abbott.

Theron said she could barely string a sentence together in English; however, with her pursuit to become an actress – that had to change.   This conversation started with the men asking if she had a South African accent growing up, as the actors agreed doing a South African accent is difficult.  Theron, in the past, has said repeatedly that she still speaks Afrikaans to her mother and was seen visiting South Africa, but she hasn’t lived in the country for over 20 years.  She also has been outspoken on political and social issues occurring in the country.
