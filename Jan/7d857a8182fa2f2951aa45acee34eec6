BEST BET RACE 4 NO 3 CAPTAIN’S RANSOM – WIN This mare is one of the best runners in the country and her record peaks for itself. She is looking for her third win in the Grade 1 Majorca Stakes and at the weights none of her five rivals looks likely to stop her. VALUE BET RACE 9: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 4-JET DARK AND 6 KOMMETDIEDING WITH 1-GOLDEN DUCAT, 2-MAKE IT SNAPPY, 5-SPARKLING WATER, 7-UNIVERSAL, 12 AL MUTHANA, 14-COUSIN CASEY, 16-LINEBACK AND 17-RASCALLION. There is a R1-million carryover on the World Sports Betting Cape Town Met Quartet with the pool likely to reach R5-million. Jet Dark and Kommetdieding fought out the finish last year and are the two most reliable runners in this event. It is always better to take the field with the two floating bankers but that would be very costly and at weight-for-age conditions might not be necessary. Also note, that if you are a TAB on-line account holder, if your Quartet loses, you will get back 10% of your stake. The full cost this bet is R672 but one can always take a percentage.
