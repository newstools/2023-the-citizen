Actress Jay Anstey shared a video in honour of her partner Sean-Marco Voster after he sprang into action to save two women who ran into some trouble with a rip tide during a recent family outing.  Jay shared the video on her timeline and explained that she chose to post the video on her feed because it deserved a main post. “@seanmarcov my hero,” she added.  The video contains captions on each scene which began with a clip of Sean-Marco playing with their small child.  “We heard two women screaming from the water,” read one of the captions before Jay explained that the water in that area has a strong rip tide that pulls people out to sea further than where they were swimming.  The video then follows Sean-Marco as he gets one woman safely to shore while struggling with the other who kept pulling him under. Luckily, he was able to also get her back to shore where he took some time to catch his breath after the harrowing experience.  The women are reunited with their families who take them away to safety.  Jay Anstey’s followers flocked to her comments to hail Sean-Marco for his heroic acts.  “What a man!” commented @langleykirkwood. “So glad Sean is OK too, it must have been nerve-wracking watching that,” said @leighmacgregor85. “Wow! So brave because so many people die in the sea trying to rescue others. I am glad your man and the ladies are fine,” wrote @livinglifewithdiana.  “My nerves are shot. So glad your man is fine. How harrowing for the saved and the saviour,” added fellow actress Nthati Moshesh.  Jay Anstey and Sean-Marco Voster both starred in M-Net drama Legacy where they played the characters of Lexi Price and Stefan Potgieter respectively.
