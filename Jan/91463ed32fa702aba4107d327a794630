President Cyril Ramaphosa has told power utility Eskom to suspend the pending 18.65% tariff increase approved by the National Energy Regular of South Africa (Nersa) until the load shedding issue has been resolved. Ramaphosa, during his closing address at the ANC Free State provincial conference, said the government felt Eskom should not implement tariff increase.  He has given the Eskom board homework to consider a proposal to suspend the tariff. But the Ramaphosa did not elaborate except to say this was one of several interventions that the government had come up with as part of relief to the people.

Nersa granted Eskom the 18.65% for the 2023 financial year to cover its debt which was estimated at R71. 4 billion in 2022 expected to be in the region of R80 this year. The state owned electricity supplier initially requested a 32% hike to cover its debt running into billions.
