Spotifyâ€™s EQUAL Africa programme has kicked off 2023 by shining its spotlight on multi-talented Nigerian artist Yemi Alade. Alade, a leading female Afro Pop artist in Africa, is the latest musician to join the list of accomplished artists featured on the EQUAL Africa playlist. The EQUAL programme seeks to equip female artistes with the support and resources to grow their craft and reach worldwide audiences through multiple playlists. The beneficiaries also receive off-platform guidance and tools to help take their music careers to even greater heights. The Afropop musician follows fellow Nigerian stars like Tiwa Savage, Ayra Starr and FAVE.
