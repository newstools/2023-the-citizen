Mtwara. Mtwara Regional Commissioner, Ahmed Abbas has touted Exim Bank as a link between Tanzania and Comoros businesses. Mr Abbas was speaking during the launch of a relocated Exim Bank branch in Mtwara town. According to him, the launch of the branch has come at the time when the region is expecting to host senior leaders from the Comoros who will be accompanied by businessmen who are expected to visit the region to explore business opportunities between the two sides. The branch was relocated to the Sokoine House (PSSSF) building, in the centre of Mtwara Municipality. “I am so pleased to hear that the bank has more than five branches in the Comoros and is also the leading bank in Comoros. The bank’s efforts give me the strength to persuade more businessmen in Mtwara to make good use of the Tanzania – Comoros business opportunities,” he said. The business opportunities include the demand for food products including beans, meat, and sesame in the Comoros. Exim’s Head of Branch Network, Agnes Kaganda said the decision to further improve the branch aims to support the government’s efforts to develop the economy of the region through major investment in the expansion of port services and the agriculture sector, a step that stimulates the growth of domestic and international trade, especially between Tanzania and Comoros. “After seeing the government’s efforts and out of respect for our customers in Mtwara, we thought it would be good to open a branch with the status they deserve. This branch is also in line with the major innovation in modern banking services involving the use of advanced technology in the provision of financial services,” she said.
