Bahlabani Ba Ntwa, meanwhile, got their goals from Celimpilo Ngema, who returned to the starting line-up after missing their previous game due to suspension, and Sibusiso Sibeko. Malesela did appear to be upset with the officiating, indicating that he did not feel the game was decided by the players.  “I am not a person who gets angry easily, I don’t get emotional often, particularly when it comes to matches and results,” said Malesela. “But really, if we are going to go on like this in football, then our football won’t go anywhere. We are trying to build players; we are trying to build clubs that are strong. We work hard at training and if these games won’t be decided by the players then we are in big trouble. “I can’t fault them for anything, the only thing I will fault them for is the pressure they put on in the second half. They should have done it as well in the first half. Yes, they put pressure on the opponents, but it should have been the same as it was in the second half. It shows that when we want to we can do things. We just have to look and see what happens in the next game, hopefully things will be different.” Gallants find themselves occupying 14th place on the standings after the loss, having only managed to collect 13 points in 14 league matches.
