He has signed a one-and-a-half year deal with the club. He is certainly going to add value to Babina Noko having played at the highest level of the game,” said the source. As reported earlier, Mokotjo was said to have been offered to Kaizer Chiefs after his contract at US side FC Cincinnati expired.  He was seen as a perfect replacement for Njabulo Blom who left Chiefs for St Louis FC in the US recently.  Amakhosi, however, decided against signing the former Bafana Bafana midfielder. Mokotjo was promoted to the SuperSport United senior team in 2009, but he moved to Feyenoord the same year to begin his international career in the Netherlands that lasted until 2017. He then moved to England in 2017 to play for Brentford FC  where he played for three seasons before moving to the US to join Cincinnati.
