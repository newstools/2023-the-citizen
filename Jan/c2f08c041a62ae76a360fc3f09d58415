The South African Police Service (SAPS) has warned the public against the unauthorised and illegal use of SAPS property. This after a video clip went viral on social media of a man sitting behind the wheel of a marked police vehicle wearing a SAPS cap. In the video, the man – who is alleged to be an illegal foreign national from Zimbabwe – is seen laughing inside the vehicle while talking to another man.
