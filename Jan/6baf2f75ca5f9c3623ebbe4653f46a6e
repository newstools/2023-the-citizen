Yes, it’s still the month of January and it looks like many people are committed to their health and fitness goals this month, with a particularly keen interest in healthy ingredients such as broccoli.  The vegetable broccoli isn’t many people’s favourite as it can conjure up memories of soggy or overcooked broccoli during supper.  However, broccoli doesn’t have to be bland or overcooked, it needs a few punchy flavours to transform it and keep an eye on it, as it just needs 10 minutes to remain soft with a bit of crunch.   Healthy eating can be delicious and satisfying.
