BEST BET RACE 3 NO 1 EKORIA – WIN This is a top-class filly and although coming back from a short break, should be far too good for this field. VALUE BET RACE 9 NO 1 ANGEL OF JUSTICE – EACHWAY This filly has had two poor runs on the Polytrack but if you go back to her third-last race, which was her first at Fairview, that was run on turf, she flew up late to be beaten just 0.55 lengths. The two bad runs on the Polytrack have resulted in a 1kg drop of her merit rating and with Louie Mxothwa up and a drop in class, 10-1 looks most appetising.
