After playing to a draw in his first game as a Sekhukhune United coach, Brandon Truter says there is a lot of improvement that needs to happen at his new club.

Truter, who was sacked by AmaZulu in October, says the result was not what his side deserved and he feels like they dropped two points at home. “We were a better team, we were dominant, our approach, our structure was very good, and our counter-pressing as well,” said Truter.  “I think our finishing can improve tremendously. So, yeah, that’s what we need. But there is so little time in between this game and our next game. The training session becomes our recovery session. We will analyse, we will get the players to observe and see what we did wrong,” said the former Swallows FC coach. “For me it’s still points dropped at home, but the positive is that … we got a clean sheet, it’s been a while, so that is a positive, but I think the boys also feel we dropped points at home.” Truter was brought as the new Sekhukhune coach to try and help the club to move away from the relegation zone following the sacking of Kaitano Tembo, who had a bad spell with the club. They are in position 15 on the league standings after only managing to collect 12 points in 13 games. Sekhukhune will be looking to make things right in their next match – they face their neighbours Marumo Gallants in a Limpopo derby on Wednesday.
