Seemingly safe for continuing for another generation post-2025, Mercedes-Benz has afforded the coupe-styled CLA and its CLA Shooting Brake sibling a mid-life facelift due to be rolled-out on South African models in due course. Showcased in 2019 as the seventh and eighth models after the A-Class hatch and sedan, the Chinese-market only A-Class Sedan L, B-Class, GLA and GLB to make use of Benz’s front-wheel-drive MFA2 platform, the adaptions include not only to the interior and exterior, but also underneath the bonnet. In the case of the exterior, Benz’s has added its high performance LED headlights as an option for the first, in addition to restyling the front apron, fitting new LED taillight clusters and as standard, gloss or sheen coated five double-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels.

In addition, the AMG-fettled CLA 35 and 45 S derivatives receive a redesigned Panamericana grille with vertical slates, standard LED or Multibeam LED headlights and new alloy wheels ranging from 18 to 19-inches on the former and 19-inches finished in matte black or gloss on the latter. Inside, the dual 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and MBUX infotainment system remains a cost option, with the standard arrangement now comprising the former and a seven-inch display. Also standard is Nappa leather for the steering wheel or Artico man-made fibres for the optional multi-function wheel, faux dark carbon fibre inserts or open-pore wood as part of the AMG Line package, a new selection of seat upholstery materials ranging from Artico to faux leather in five colours and a heated steering wheel on AMG Line models. New on AMG models is the standard inclusion of the AMG Performance steering wheel and dual MBUX system, plus four new colours for the sport seats or optional AMG Performance chairs. Up front, all models, regardless of fuel type, feature the 48-volt mild-hybrid system that increases power outputs by 10 kW for short spells. In addition, the six-speed manual gearbox bows out entirely as per Benz’s confirmation last year that it won’t be offering any of its models with three-pedals by the end of this year. On the petrol front, two engines feature, the familiar 1.3-litre co-developed with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance that produces 100kW/230Nm in 180 models and 120kW/270Nm in 200 derivatives, and Benz’s own 2.0-litre that pumps-out 140kW/300Nm in the CLA 220 and 165kW/350Nm in the 250. Providing diesel motivation is the stalwart 2.0-litre unit in three states of tune; 85kW/280Nm in the CLA 180d, 110kW/320Nm in the 200d and 140kW/400Nm in the CLA 220d. With the exception of the 220 being limited to the “sedan”, the rest of the engine range can be specified in the Shooting Brake as well, with the 4Matic all-wheel-drive system being exclusive to it and the 250. Introduced three years ago, the plug-in hybrid 250e models benefit from a new electric motor that delivers improved range, but not more power. This means the combination of the 120kW 1.3-litre engine and 15.6kWh lithium-ion battery continues to produce 160kW/450Nm, with the claimed all-electric range increasing from 69km to 82 km in the CLA and from 68 km to 80 km in the CLA Shooting Brake. As with its petrol and diesel siblings, the inclusion of the 48-volt system has not impacted on the outputs of either AMG model, meaning 225kW/400Nm from the 2.0-litre unit in the CLA 35 and 310kW/500Nm in the 45 S. Performance figures are also unchanged regardless of bodystyle with the CLA 35 getting from 0-100 km/h in 4.9 seconds and onto a top speed of 250 km/h and the 45 S in 4.1 seconds before hitting the electronic limiter at 270 km/h. On-sale in Europe from later this year, the respective changes are set to be applied to the South African market CLA and AMG CLA in due course, although only to the conventional model as the Shooting Brake will remain forbidden fruit for foreseeable future.
