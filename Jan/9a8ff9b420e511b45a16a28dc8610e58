An indoor go-karting race track in KwaZulu-Natal has been closed after a 15-year-old girl suffered serious injuries. It is understood Kristen Govender was out with her family at Action Karting at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping in Umhlanga when the accident happened. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube said according to reports, the teen sustained spinal injuries, a torn aorta and a torn scalp as a result of the go-karting incident. Dube-Ncube said she is deeply concerned about the condition of the young girl who is fighting for her life in a Durban hospital. Dube-Ncube has ordered a full investigation into the incident to ensure that children are not exposed to such risks in future. “We are on the eve of the start of the 2023 school year and we are saddened that this young girl will not be able to start the school year in the first term. We have shut down the go-Kart establishment at the Gateway Theatre of Shopping indefinitely pending the outcome of the investigation into the incident.” “We were also very disturbed to learn that when our teams went to inspect the area, they did not get cooperation from the management of the amusement park. We call on the police to leave no stone unturned in order to get to the bottom of this horrific incident,” said Dube-Ncube.
