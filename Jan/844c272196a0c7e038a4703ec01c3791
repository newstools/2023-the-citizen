South African singer and actor, Bobby van Jaarsveld and his family made the most of their December holiday, ringing in the New Year at the coast. Bobby documented their family holiday, which kicked off in Ballito in KwaZulu-Natal where the family lives, before they headed to Mozambique and Sodwana Bay.   Bobby and his wife, Anna, also celebrated their 12-year wedding anniversary on Saturday, 7 January. The 35-year-old singer took to Instagram to wish his wife a happy anniversary. “12 years married today. And we have been together since Gr 11. “Can’t honestly say that it was easy until here, but the fact that we can still stand here in each other’s arms and laugh means that we have made it through many storms together. “I hate it when people say that marriage is hard work (but it’s also probably true) but it should be fun every now and then to be married and not just a ‘marriage-in and marriage-out’ situation or rather not a ‘here-I-want-in and here-I-want-out’ situation. “But thanks Anna… we keep the balance well, I think. We fight a lot, but we kiss even better. I really learn a lot from you even if I don’t want to admit it. You are an exceptional mother for our children and the perfect wife for me. And yes, I will choose you again. Every day. Again, and again…” Bobby’s heartfelt message to his wife read.
