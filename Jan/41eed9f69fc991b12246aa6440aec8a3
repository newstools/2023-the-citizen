GREYVILLE TURF BEST BET RACE 2 NO 2 AERIAL DISPLAY – WIN There has been a lot of rain in Durban and the going is said to be good to soft. Aerial Display ran second last time over 1400m at this track in yielding going, producing the faster 400m to finish. The gelding will also benefit from the extra 200m this time. VALUE BET JACKPOT 1 (RACES 5 TO 8) R300 Leg 1: 2, 3, 5, 8, 11 Leg 2: 1, 6, 8  Leg 3: 6, 7 Leg 4: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14  This could yield a decent return if we can catch it. Remember, one can always take a percentage, from 2% in this case (minimum bet R6) upwards.
