Fresh from a year that saw the petrol price hit record highs, the first hike of 2023 awaits South African motorists on Wednesday … and it is only February. After getting some relief at the start of January, fuel prices go up at midnight with the main culprit an increase in the price of brent crude oil. Much to the relief of cash-strapped consumers is that the hike is only a marginal one compared to the horror show that went on for most of 2022.

We have picked six vehicles and worked out how much it will cost to fill them from completely empty and how much the cost per kilometre works out to for each. One of the cars that will be the least affected by the petrol price hike, the Celerio will only cost R8.96 more on Wednesday than it did to fill in January. Suzuki claims it will only sip 4.4 litres of petrol for every 100km, which makes it possible for the Celerio to travel all of 727km on its 32-litre tank. This works out to 94 cents per kilometre. As from Wednesday, it will cost R11.20 more to fill the 40-litre petrol tank of one of South Africa’s favourite compact SUVs. According to Renault, this Kiger will sip 5.3 litres for every 100km, which makes a range of 755km possible. This means that every kilometre will work out to R1.13.
