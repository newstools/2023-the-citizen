Dr. Zainab Diwa said that current courts are overwhelmed with ongoing proceedings, which require evidence before a decision can be made, a process that takes a long time, unlike mediation. “The mediation process does not take long, it takes only 30 days. This is in accordance with our constitution Article 107A(1)(d),” she said. Speaking on behalf of other legal assistants sponsored by LSF, Anthony Isakwi has said that mediation has also been a key tool for civil cases in solving many disputes. “Civil cases are the most likely to be arbitrated. Criminal cases, however, such as sexual violence and others, are handled through cooperation with other stakeholders and brought to court, where justice can be served.
