At 33-years old, the Tembisa born midfielder was recently the star of the show when Sundowns edged Orlando Pirates 2-0 in their first game after the Fifa break, as the Pretoria outfit took their points tally to 31 in the log standings after only playing 13 league matches.  Sekwale says Zwane’s performance is because of his loyalty to the game and that has helped him to grow as a player. “He is definitely the best player in the league, and he has been consistent for many years now. I can’t even remember the day where he played and he didn’t perform,” said Sekwale.  As a player, you do get to go through a game whereby it is not your day, but him, even if it is not his day he will not give you a poor performance.”  “I believe you saw him during their game against Pirates, he was outstanding, there was no player at Pirates that could touch him.  “He was the best player in that game and Pirates players struggled to contain him. They weres cared to mark him, he was so relaxed. It was like he was in training. So, when I look at it, I don’t think there is any player that can match him. He will just continue to be the best in the league.”
