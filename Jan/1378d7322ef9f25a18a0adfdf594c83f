Orlando Pirates coach Jose Riveiro has shared his views on new specialist coach Scott Chickelday, who will be working with the club’s strikers to help be lethal in front of goals. ALSO READ: Riveiro gives reasons behind Pirates’ poor form Pirates have struggled upfront this season, with the club only scoring 10 goals in the DStv Premiership from 15 matches. Their scoring problem has seen the club go down to eighth place on the log with 19 points. Riveiro believes having Chickelday as part of their technical team will help the team and is looking forward to working with him as a unit. “It is one more element in the coaching (department) that is also here to try and optimise the talent we have, so that we get better figures in every unit. We are learning to work with a specialist, one more in our squad and we also have people who are specially working in different things in the team unit,” said the Spaniard. “Scott is going to help us with a specific one. And in the end when we succeed, that’s going to be the consequence of a lot of things that we do together.” Chickelday began training with Pirates last week after the Englishman announced on social media that he will be part of the Pirates coaching staff. He will be sharpening the scoring skills of the likes of Kermit Erasmus, Eva Nga, Terrence Dzvukamanja, Evidence Makgopa and Zakhele Lepasa.
