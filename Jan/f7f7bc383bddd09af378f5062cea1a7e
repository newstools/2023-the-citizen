Having premiered in Australia last November, Haval has officially announced price and specification details for the Jolion S that succeeds the Super Luxury as the line-up’s new flagship model. The new sportiest derivative of the smash-hit Jolion that regularly posts four digit sales numbers come the monthly Naamsa figures, the S builds on the Super Luxury, but with a series of exterior and interior tweaks.

Somewhat oddly, Haval has opted against making the physical buttons for some of the switchgear available on the South African market S as it has on the Australian version. A so-called eco-leather fabric adorns the steering wheel, with the front seats now being heated. A key aspect of what continues to make the Jolion a success, its standard specification sheet, prevails with the S as items on offer includes a six-speaker sound system, electric driver’s seat, a wireless smartphone charger, keyless and push-button start, as well as: Centre to the S’ inclusion is its dynamic alternations, namely a multi-link rear suspension Haval claims “ensures extensively enhanced ride and handling performance during both regular and sporty driving”. In addition, Haval has also extracted an additional 25kW/60Nm from the 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine, meaning outputs now stand at 130kW/270Nm. A faster shifting seven-speed dual-clutch transmission delivers the amount of grunt to the front wheels with a first time Launch Control being included as well. No performance figures were, however, disclosed. Now available, the S, like the rest of the Jolion range, adds a five-year/100 000 km warranty as well as five-year/60 000 km service plan to its price tag.
