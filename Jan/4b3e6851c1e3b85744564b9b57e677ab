Bulls director of rugby Jake White has undergone emergency surgery to his stomach region and is recovering in hospital. White accompanied his Bulls team to Wales this last weekend for a United Rugby Championship match against the Dragons but was unable to attend the match because he was feeling unwell. Flyhalf Chris Smith also withdrew from the matchday squad because he, too, wasn’t well. The Bulls won the match against the Dragons. On the team’s arrival back in South Africa on Sunday morning White complained of experiencing severe stomach cramps and he underwent emergency abdominal surgery later in the day. It is not known what was specifically bothering the former Springbok coach.

He will, however, take some time off. Bulls CEO Edgar Rathbone visited White on Monday morning. “It is never nice to see one of our own down but we are extremely confident that Jake is receiving the best medical attention available and our team of medical experts will provide him with all the necessary support he will need to make a full recovery,” said Rathbone. “We would like to thank the hospital team, doctors and all those who rushed to offer their expertise and helped with attending to Jake. We have seen, first-hand, why South African medicine is rated among the best in the world. Thank you.” While recovering from the operation and going through his rehabilitation programme, White will take a brief break from his team duties and return to work on February 8.  The coaching responsibilities over the next few weeks will be shared by the other members of the management team.
