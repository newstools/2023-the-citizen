Linda Mntambo is set to return to Sekhukhune United training soon, but head coach Brandon Truter says the midfielder may still need some time before he becomes a regular in the starting line-up again.

With his skipper coming back, Truter says it is a plus for his team, especially since the midfielder is a key member of his squad, but adds that they will still have to manage him well. “With the injuries we still have players who are on the mend and on their way back, they are in the final phases of their rehab program, specifically Linda. He is getting there slowly, but surely. He is a big player for us, a key player in our system. He is also the captain of the club as well,” said Truter. “So, welcoming back to the fold will be a massive plus for us. At this stage he’s close, but not ready yet. We also have to look at match minutes to manage him, the pain is better, the swelling is down. The physio and the whole medical team are happy with his progress and I can’t wait to have him back.” Truter added that he could not wait to have other injured players like Seth Parusnath back. “There are still some other few guys (who are out) who can add value to the current team, to bring some competition and even raise the training intensity and level. I can’t wait to have them back,” he concluded.
