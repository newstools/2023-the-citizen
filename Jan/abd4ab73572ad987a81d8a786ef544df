Talented fullback Henry Immelman — a former pupil at Grey College — has joined the Bulls on a three-year deal. Immelman, who turned out for CUT in the Varsity Cup and also featured for the Free State U20s, has played most of his professional rugby in Europe — five seasons with Montpellier and the last two seasons with Edinburgh.

Bulls CEO Edgar Rathbone called Immelman’s signing a “homecoming”. “Henry’s homecoming adds to our depth as the Bulls. He has a wealth of experience having played against sides that we are now going head-to-head with in the United Rugby Championship and Champions Cup, and that is an added bonus that the rest of the team can tap into,” said Rathbone. “We welcome Henry to Loftus and we are confident that he will add value to the Bulls product and brand of rugby that we pride ourselves on as a club. We are happy to have him join our family and know that he will enjoy a fruitful time with us.” Immelman said he would be sad saying goodbye to the people of Edinburgh. “I’ve enjoyed every minute of my time at Edinburgh. It’s a brilliant club with an exceptional group of boys. Since day one they welcomed me with open arms, and I’ve really started to enjoy my rugby a lot more. “Away trips with the Edinburgh boys are probably the one thing that I’ll miss the most. I want to thank the Edinburgh fans for all the support too. I’ve been proud to represent them and this great city during the last two seasons.” Regarding his move to Pretoria, he said: “For me personally, joining the Bulls is a great opportunity. They are another world class club and I’ll be closer to my family as well.”
