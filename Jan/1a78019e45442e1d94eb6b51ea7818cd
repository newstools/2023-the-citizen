Reserve Bank governor LesetjaKganyago announced this while delivering the Monetary Policy Committee’s (MPC’s) statement on Thursday afternoon. The Bank’s MPC decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.25% per year. This will take effect from 27 January. The increase in the interest rate is at least smaller than the previous three hikes in South Africa, which were all by 75 basis points.
