Dar es Salaam. Simba SC new head coach Roberto Oliveira alias Robertihno will today at 7pm be facing the first test in the Mainland Tanzania NBC Premier League encounter against Mbeya City at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium in Dar es Salaam. Robertihno has signed a two-year contract with the Msimbazi Street giants, replacing Zoran “Maki” Manojlovic, who opted to leave the club after securing a good deal with Egypt’s top-tier side Al Ittihad. After Maki’s departure, Simba were under acting head coach Juma Mgunda since September 10, last year, guiding the team to good results. Robertihno, who was Uganda’s Vipers FC head coach, is with the Msimbazi Street giants for not less than 10 days, leading the squad in two friendly games against Al Dhafra FC of the United Arabs Emirates, who won 1-0 and against CSKA Moscow, whom they drew 2-2. Both friendly games were held in Abu Dhabi. Simba are now placed second with 44 points from 19 matches while Mbeya City are in the 10th slot after collecting 21 points from 19 matches. Young Africans are at the top of the league standings with 53 points from 20 matches. Other teams in the top five are Azam FC who are in the third position with 43 points from 20 matches and Singida Big Stars who are placed fourth after collecting 37 points. Singida Big Stars were yesterday in action against Kagera Sugar in the league match. Also in the top five are Geita Gold FC with 27 points from 20 matches. “We hope to do our best in the encounter. It will be my first time to supervise the technical bench of the club since I joined the team. My players are in good shape to face the challenge of Mbeya City players,” said Robertihno. Mbeya City assistant coach Anthon Mwamlima said they are well prepared for the encounter and believes they are going to record a good result. According to Mwamlima, they are taking the encounter very seriously, quite knowing that they are facing a tough team.
