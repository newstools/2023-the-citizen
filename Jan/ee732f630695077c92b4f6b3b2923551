Sekhkhune United popped Kaizer Chiefs’ 53rd birthday balloons on Saturday, Brandon Truter’s men stunning Arthur Zwane’s Amakhosi with a 1-0 DStv Premiership win at FNB Stadium.

Chiefs were celebrating their 53rd birthday at home but couldn’t make the most of their chances, Caleb Bimenyimana unable to find his shooting boots on the day. The result means Amakhosi remain 13 points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns in the table at exactly the halfway stage of the season.  “We started sluggish, then we gained momentum and were in control of the game,” Zwane told SuperSport TV after the match. Sekhukhune went in front in the 49th minute as Dove Wome lost posession and Mncube burst clear beating Khune with a low shot. “Sometimes these things happen, you ask yourself questions but I can’t fault the boys,” added Zwane. “The pitch also did not make life easy, it was a bit soft and bumpy, but with the chances we created we could have buried them. Today it wasn’t to be.” Keagan Dolly had to come off with an injury for Chiefs in the 63rd minute but Zwane did not feel it upset Chiefs’ momentum too much. “I think we were actually on the front foot just after introducing Ashley (Du Preez), Mduduzi (Shabalala) and Kgoagelo (Sekgota),” said Zwane. “We tried to put them under pressure and force mistakes but we were just unfortunate. “I think we should have had a penalty when Caleb was running towards the ball and was pulled. “The boys tried and conceded a goal against the run of play that we shouldn’t have. It was our mistake.”
