For the first time in its history, the game between Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns this coming weekend can best be described using the biblical reference “David v Goliath”.  ALSO READ: Zwane set to stay put at Chiefs, at least for now This is because going into the match, Kaizer Chiefs look to be the sacrificial lambs who Sundowns could roast on their way to securing their 12th DStv Premiership title.The two giants of local football meet at FNB Stadium in a DStv Premiership match on Saturday (kick-off 8pm).Even some of the Amakhosi supporters have lost faith in their team and do not see Arthur Zwane’s side upsetting Rulani Mokwena’s mean machine.Chiefs have even been a subject of ridicule on social media. Replying to Chiefs’ Facebook post about Saturday’s game, one supporter urged them to rather get sick leave notes and skip the game.A joke also trended on social media and it went: “If you feel useless, take comfort in knowing that Kaizer Chiefs players are training to beat Sundowns right now.”And that is understandable looking at the past few games of both teams. The jokes about Chiefs started after their embarrassing 4-0 loss to AmaZulu FC last weekend.On the other side, until Monday’s 1-0 win at SuperSport United, Sundowns had been free- scoring, winning their previous three matches 2-0.But, this could be the game that Zwane’s side need to get their groove back and stop the bad run they have been on. He will definitely not need to motivate his players for this one.The fact that they have nothing to lose in the game should inspire them to go all out and look to do what only two other teams have managed this season.ALSO READ: Chiefs players read the riot act by Kaizer Junior after Usuthu lossZwane’s youngsters will be presented with a chance to show what they are capable of in a big game.The Chiefs mentor has leaned towards more youngsters from the club’s youth structures but they are yet to click.“The players have done tremendously well given we have a mixture of young and old playing personnel. We are on the right track,” Zwane said earlier this month.“The second round (of the season) will not be easy. There will be teams who want to avoid relegation. Teams who want to be in the top eight and teams who are vying for the league title,” added the under-fire Chiefs mentor.It will however only be known on Saturday whether Chiefs will be sacrificial lambs or become the biblical David and do the unthinkable.
