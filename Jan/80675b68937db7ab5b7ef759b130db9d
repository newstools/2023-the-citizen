AmaZulu have confirmed that they have reached an agreement for midfielder Makhehleni Makhaula to join Orlando Pirates immediately.  ALSO READ: SuperSport snatch Pirates’ Lepasa on loan Makhaula, the Usuthu captain, had already signed a pre-contract to join the Buccaneers next season, but the two clubs have now negotiated his early departure from the KZN side.  “Makahula leaves with our full blessings, he served the club very well as captain and was the recipient of the President’s and the Player’s Player of the Year awards two seasons ago with merit,” said AmaZulu chairman Sandile Zungu in a club statement.  Makhaula joined AmaZulu on a free transfer in October 2020 after leaving Highlands Park and was a key member of Benni McCarthy’s Usuthu side that finished second in the DStv Premiership in the 2020/21 season and played in the following campaign’s Caf Champions League.  He has remained a mainstay in the AmaZulu midfield since playing in 13 of the side’s 18 top flight games so far this season.  Makhaula is set to compete in the heart of the Buccaneers midfield with the likes of Goodman Mosele and Thabang Monare, and is joining a Buccaneers side in excellent form, having won their last three league games in a row.
