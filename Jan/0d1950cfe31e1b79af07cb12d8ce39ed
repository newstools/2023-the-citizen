Springbok Sevens star JC Pretorius is set to make his Lions debut in the Challenge Cup match against French side Stade Francais in Paris on Saturday, while Jaco Kriel returns to the side after injury. These are among the personnel changes to the side that went down 33-3 against Munster in a URC match in Cork last weekend. Also, Gianni Lombard returns at flyhalf, taking over from Jordan Hendrikse who has an ankle injury. There is also a potential debut on the cards for former Paarl Boys pupil Rhynardt Rijnsburger, who could feature in the front row at some stage.  Speaking to the media earlier this week, the Lions’ attack coach Ricardo Loubscher said Saturday’s challenge in the French capital would be an opportunity for the players to turn the tide, after a string of defeats.

Speaking from experience, they are a different team at home. They are more passionate in front of their home fans combined with providing entertainment through their style of rugby.” Kick-off is 3pm.
