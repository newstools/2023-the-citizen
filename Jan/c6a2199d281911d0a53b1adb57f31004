Monday 2 January  S10 V3 Liverpool are hoping for a bright start to the year, and an improvement in their fortunes, but will find a tough host as they play at Brentford on Monday. M1 Glasgow Rangers vs Glasgow Celtic: Celtic have a nine-point lead over second placed Rangers as they look well placed to go on and win the Scottish Premiership for an 11th time in 12 seasons. M2 Racing Strasbourg vs Troyes: Strasbourg lost 2-1 at champions PSG in their first game back after the World Cup break and sit second from bottom in the French league. Troyes are on an eight match winless streak in Ligue 1. M3 Barnsley vs Bolton Wanderers: Barnsley won 2-1 at Bolton last month in the FA Cup and now host them in League One action. M4 Cliftonville vs Larne: A home win would see Cliftonville cut Larne’s three point lead at the top of the Northern Ireland league. M5 Heart of Midlothian vs Hibernian: Hearts collected seven points from their last three Scottish Premiership fixtures and are in third spot. Hibs lost 4-0 at home to Celtic in their last outing. M6 Lincoln City vs Ipswich Town: Lincoln host Ipswich for a sixth time with three victories and two defeats from their five previous visits. M7 Linfield vs Coleraine: Linfield have eight wins and two draws from their last 10 games in the Northern Ireland league. Coleraine are on a seven match unbeaten run. M8 Northampton Town vs Leyton Orient: Orient are the runaway leaders in League Two while Northampton are also among the promotion-seeking frontrunners. M9 Swansea City vs Burnley: Swansea have a strong home record against Championship frontrunners Burnley with five wins in seven games plus one draw and a defeat back in 1995. M10 Brentford vs Liverpool: Last season Brentford held Liverpool 3-3 at home but then lost 3-0 in the reverse league fixture at Anfield.
