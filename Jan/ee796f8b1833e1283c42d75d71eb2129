Showcased in its current third generation four years ago, Mercedes-Benz has introduced a new version of its iconic Sprinter van buyers will be able to snap-up from February. Replacing the 516 CDI that filled the gap between the 319 CDI and the top-spec 519 CDI until now, the new Sprinter 517 CDI, as before, only comes in panel van bodystyle and in standard wheelbase form with no extended length being offered for now. Dimensionally, the Sprinter 517 CDI is unchanged from the 516 CDI as it once again measures 5 932 mm in overall length, stands 2 331 mm tall and comes with a width of 2 175 mm. Weighing 3 550 kg, the load compartment itself stretches 3 272 mm and can accommodate a cargo volume of 11m3. Somewhat strangely, no details regarding the payload figures were revealed. Aesthetically unchanged from its predecessor bar the 516 CDI designation on the grille and rear doors making way for the new 517 CDI badges, the biggest difference, as evident by the moniker, is the debut of Benz’s new OM 654 2.0-litre turbodiesel engine underneath bonnet. ALSO READ: Sprint into the future with the third-generation Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Lighter than the outgoing 2.1-litre OM 651 unit as a result of making broader use out of aluminium and said to be better at preventing heat build-up, the Euro VI compliant mill is also more powerful with outputs of 125kW/400Nm versus 120kW/380Nm. As before, drive is routed to the rear wheels via a standard six-speed manual gearbox or an optional 9G Tronic automatic. In spite of Mercedes-Benz not detailing the Sprinter 517 CDI’s interior, expect items on offer to consist of air-conditioning, a basic MBUX enabled infotainment system, electric mirrors, a wireless smartphone charger, electric windows and even a multi-function steering wheel. Notable safety and driver assistance systems, either standard or optional, comprise a 360-degree surround-view camera system, Active Distance Assist Distronic, Blind Spot Assist, Lane Keep Assist and Rear Cross Traffic Alert. Available in nine colours; Arctic White, Jet Black, Blue Grey, Steel Blue, Jupiter Red, Iridium Silver Metallic, Obsidian Black Metallic, Tenorite Grey Metallic and Canavansite Blue Metallic, pricing for the Sprinter 517 CDI kicks-off at R932 084 and includes a three-year/unlimited km warranty with a service plan being optional.
