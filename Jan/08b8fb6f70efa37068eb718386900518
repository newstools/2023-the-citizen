Former junior star and Lions centre Wandisile Simelane will feature in his favourite position in the midfield for the Bulls when the Pretoria-based side take on the Dragons in a United Rugby Championship match in Newport on Friday night.  Since joining the Bulls from the Lions a year ago Simelane has had to be happy playing mainly at fullback and wing. On Friday though he will play in the No 13 jersey with Harold Vorster, also a former Lions player, at inside centre.

Zak Burger comes in at scrumhalf, while David Kriel also returns on the wing. Kurt-Lee Arendse will play fullback. There are also a few changes on the bench where Bismarck du Plessis, Embrose Papier, Johan Goosen and Cornal Hendricks have plenty of experience to make an impact when required to do so. The match on Friday kicks off at 9.45pm.  Bulls: Kurt-Lee Arendse, Canan Moodie, Wandisile Simelane, Harold Vorster, David Kriel, Chris Smith, Zak Burger, Elrigh Louw, Cyle Brink, Marco van Staden, Ruan Nortje (capt), Ruan Vermaak, Mornay Smith, Johan Grobbelaar, Gerhard Steenekamp. Bench: Simphiwe Matanzima, Bismarck du Plessis, Sebastian Lombard, Janko Swanepoel, Nizaam Carr, Embrose Papier, Johan Goosen, Cornal Hendricks
