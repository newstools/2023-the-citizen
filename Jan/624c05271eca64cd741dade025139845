This week, viewers of The Wife got to see what happened in the aftermath of Qhawe and Naledi’s accident which saw Naledi in need of surgery while Qhawe survived with minimal injuries.  In the dramatic fashion of the show, she found herself in need of surgery and it was – coincidentally – performed by her colleague (Tsietsi) and she was discharged shortly thereafter to go recover at home under the care of her father and boyfriend.  The way Qhawe is always screaming NALEDI????????????#TheWifeShowMax— ???? (@armoured_cable) January 6, 2023 This came after a brief hospital stay where her sister (Tshedi) overheard their father telling an unconscious Naledi that he would choose to save her over Tshedi if faced with a life-threatening emergency between the two of them. If the love of my life doesn’t talk about me like this then surely I have failed. ???????????? #TheWifeShowmax pic.twitter.com/VTVeUWPADg— Tlhalefo.???? (@Tlhaxdova) December 29, 2022 Viewers of The Wife were further subjected to awkward, nonsensical exchanges between chief Kgosi and Qhawe as the sworn enemies continued to plot against each other.  ALSO READ: ‘The Wife’: Mo Setumo explains why Tshedi does the things she does Elsewhere in the storyline, Hlomu dealt with the aftermath of the fight she got into at the opening of her restaurant. Hlomu also seems to be kicking off a new romance with someone unexpected. An affair that Mqhele will most likely use as an excuse to abuse Hlomu once again.  Next week Hlomu is receiving a beating ???????????? #TheWifeShowmax— Kay (@Misskaykei) January 6, 2023 I'm really scared for Hlomu, the anger in Mqele's face when she rejected his call ???? #TheWifeShowmax— refiloe (@peaches_re) January 6, 2023 In between the drama with Hlomu and the drama with Naledi were some scenes with Sambulo and Xoli, and most fans of The Wife have complained about the sex scenes stating that they are played out and highly unnecessary at this point.  Catching up with my favs and the sex scenes are hot yoh ???? #TheWifeShowmax— Biggies Problem ???????????? (@madam_kay_hun) January 6, 2023 I would rather have the Majola brothers back with their annoying selves then these sex scenes????????????#TheWifeShowmax— Zeigh_Banzi (@BanziZeigh) January 6, 2023 writers need to stop with the sex scenes and honeymoon phase kinda scenes. We need raw emotions. Sambulo is a very complex character we should be seeing Xoli struggling 2 get him to open up not this really. Sambulo's intense nature wud hv given a great storyline. #TheWifeShowmax— Zeigh_Banzi (@BanziZeigh) January 6, 2023 The illegal diamond business storyline also cooled off a little this week in lieu of the focus on Naledi and Hlomu, however, the chief and his associates were able to discover, this week, that the Zulu brothers are the ones behind their troubles. Every single episode Naledi’s family call the Zulu brothers Matebele ???? they are so rude…. But the Zulu brothers also call them Mapedi ???? #TheWifeShowmax— Mrs Omphile???? (@ompimissfrenchy) January 6, 2023 Stained Glass Productions messed up Hlomu the wife. Bahlulekile shame, they can't even proceed to the last two books.  #TheWifeShowmax— Mommy ❤❤???????? (@Nwabi_0913) January 6, 2023 Someone need to tell the writers & producers of #TheWifeShowmax that they do not need to add sex scenes in every episode please can they brika nou pic.twitter.com/LMIu6Klm3b— Nonto yamaLangeni ✊ (@gaselanonto) January 5, 2023 READ NEXT: The Wife: Sex tape scandal causes further strain between Qhawe and Naledi
