With no replacement currently in sight, a report from Australia has alleged that Toyota will soon be bringing to a halt the 4.5 D4-D turbodiesel V8 engine powering the venerable Land Cruiser 70-series. A staple of the 76 station wagon, 79 single single cab and 79 double cab, but not the 78 Troopy, since debuting in 2013 with a single turbocharger compared to the twin-turbo setup employed in the now discontinued Land Cruiser 200, the V8’s future has been doubtful ever since the reveal of the Land Cruiser 300 that employs a smaller but more powerful 3.3-litre V6 oil-burner.

According to the claims from carsguide.com, the 70-series will return to its home market of Japan powered by the 2.8 GD-6 unit from the Fortuner, Prado and Hilux. Reportedly, it will be powerful than the V8 which currently delivers 151kW/430Nm. Given that the four-cylinder already has more torque than the bent-eight, 500 Nm in the Fortuner, Hilux and Prado while being one kilowatt down on the power front, the rumour appears almost justifiable despite no confirmation from Toyota itself. A further catalyst to the Land Cruiser 70-series potentially going the GD-6 route is the presence of the Hilux GR Sport that utilises the same engine, but with raised outputs of 165kW/550Nm. In addition, reports have continued to simmer that the next generation Fortuner will have a 48-volt mild-hybrid system combined with the GD-6, which will result in the Land Cruiser 70-series becoming a diesel/hybrid once seen as a viable powerunit option for the Land Cruiser 300. Along with the smaller diesel, the report goes further by alleging that the five-speed manual gearbox will also fall away and have in its place, the six-speed automatic used on the Hilux, Fortuner and Prado. If so, it will avail the 70-series with an automatic transmission not offered since the 1990s when select markets had access to a four-speed self-shifter. For now though, the V8 remains and despite the supply constraints in Australia, Toyota South Africa isn’t experiencing the same hold-ups after confirming to The Citizen last year that a “stop-ordering” on Land Cruiser 70-series sales have not been implemented.
