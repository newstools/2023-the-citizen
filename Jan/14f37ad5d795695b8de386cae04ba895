Zuchu will be putting on a stadium concert just days after being heavily criticised for her New Year Eve show alongside her boss, Diamond Platnumz. Taking to her IG Stories, Zuchu announced that she will be performing at the Stade Omnisports de Malouzini in the Comoros on January 7, 2023. The stadium has a capacity of 10,726. After hyping up their New Year’s show dubbed ‘Cheers’ for over a month, Zuchu and Diamond delivered a poorly coordinated performance that received criticism from their fans. From shared videos of their performance of ‘Mtasubiri’, the duo seemed ill-prepared and unrehearsed for the December 31, 2022 evening concert. Displeased fans pointed out that Diamond was running out of breath and constantly singing off-key. Others claimed that he had misrepresented Tanzanian live music and needed to do better. Fans felt Diamond needed to take a lot of cues and lessons from his Nigerian counterparts, like Burna Boy and Davido, who have performed on global stages.
