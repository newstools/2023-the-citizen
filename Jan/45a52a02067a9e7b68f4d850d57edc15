It has been a long time since he played at this level.  So, for an offensive player like that to get the pace back, it will take a couple of games.”  Folz is hoping that his team will tick and give a good performance, complemented with a good result when they host Kaizer Chiefs at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday. “There is always pressure in every game you play and if I look at the table, we are not where we want to be, but we are not far away as well, so we will be back… “We are still in the process of doing something. I’m not happy with the results, but we will be back soon and we will do our best in our next match against Kaizer Chiefs on Friday.”
