Sharks boss Neil Powell has decided to rest key Springboks players Eben Etzebeth, Siya Kolisi, Jaden Hendrikse and Lukhanyo Am for Saturday’s United Rugby Championship match against Edinburgh in Scotland. In total, Powell has made five changes to last week’s side that featured in the Champions Cup. Vincent Tshituka is the other player to get a break from URC action this week. The players coming into the team are Hyron Andrews, the Venter duo of James and Henco, while in the backline Grant Williams and Francois Venter come into the mix. “At this stage of the season, we’ve addressed where we’re lying on the log and where we feel we should be sitting, but we have played two games less than some of the teams, and we know the games we have left we have to win and that starts this weekend where we’re looking to put in a good performance,” said Ben Tapuai, who’ll partner Venter in midfield. Despite the Edinburgh team missing players to the Scottish camp this weekend, the Australian international believes their opponents will be no less dangerous. “We can’t read too much into that, they are a very strong, quality side that has been in this competition for a long time, while this is only our second year and we’re still learning the ropes. “Whether they have their Scottish internationals or they don’t, we know it’s important for their campaign to try and finish as high as they can, and it’s the same for us.” ALSO READ: Is Cheetahs’ participation in Challenge Cup sustainable?
