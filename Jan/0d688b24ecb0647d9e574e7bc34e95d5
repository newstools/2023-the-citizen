Williams announced the appointment of James Vowles as their new team principal following the departure last month of Jost Capito. Vowles, who joins from Mercedes, is just the third person to fill the post in the 46-year history of the team after founder Frank Williams and Capito. The Briton, who was motorsport strategy director at Mercedes, where he worked with seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, said he could not wait to get started. “It’s an honour to join a team with such an incredibly rich heritage,” James Vowles said. “The team is an icon of our sport, one I greatly respect, and I am very much looking forward to the challenge.” ALSO READ: Jost Capito departs as Williams F1 boss Williams was acquired by US-based investment firm Dorilton Capital in 2020.
