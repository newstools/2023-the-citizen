The matric results for 2022 have been released but not everyone is pleased.  The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) congratulated the matric class of 2022 after it achieved a pass rate of 80.1%, but said the achievement came “in the face of poor service delivery”. “The feat by these young people, particularly those who have not been afforded the luxuries that come with the separate development and that is entrenched by the Independent Examination Board (IEB), is both inspiring and saddening, as no young person should pursue education through difficult and dehumanising conditions,” said the EFF. The party also urged the pupils that didn’t pass to not give up. “There are measures to improve your results and pursue alternative educational measures in the interim, which will contribute to the developmental needs of South Africa.” Live updates will appear below.
