The outcome of the Class of 2022’s National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations will be made available via The Citizen’s matric results portal.  Live updates will appear below. Umalusi briefed the media earlier this week, with CEO Mafu Rakometsi saying the release of matric results had been delayed by Covid-19, load shedding and community protests. Since schools reopened late in 2022, Rakometsi said Covid-19 had a knock-on effect on examinations which started on 31 October. Umalusi also expressed concern over allegations of cheating which were uncovered in some centres during the examinations. The DBE results are preliminary, and therefore, in the case of omissions, candidates must contact their schools.

At least 89.32% of the cohort achieved entry to degree study, compared to 89.2% in 2021, while 7.52% qualified for entry to diploma study, and 1.57% at the Higher Certificate level. Anne Oberholzer, IEB CEO, said the matric results are “outstanding” as the class of 2022 were hardest hit by Covid-19. “While the Class of 2022 has seen how previous Grade 12 classes of 2020 and 2021 managed to adapt to a new reality, this was the class that missed out the most in their Grade 10 and Grade 11 years, which are fundamentally important to success in their Grade 12 performance,” said Oberholzer.
