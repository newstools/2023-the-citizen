Apple has unveiled its second generation HomePod, a smart speaker that it said delivers next-level acoustics. The second generation HomePod features the same 4-inch-high excursion woofer as before. New five horn-loaded tweeters replace the seven on the original model while six microphones of the original model have been replaced by four new far-field mics. There is also an internal low-frequency calibration mic for automatic bass correction. The new HomePod boasts a seamless, acoustically transparent mesh fabric and a backlit touch surface that illuminates from edge to edge. Like the original model, the new HomePod’s technology can do automatic room correction by listening to feedback from the microphones and calibrating itself. It has the Apple S7 SoC helping with computational audio and real-time tuning. Apple said with room sensing technology, HomePod recognises sound reflections from nearby surfaces to determine if it is against a wall or freestanding, and then adapts sound in real time. “Precise directional control of its beamforming array of five tweeters separates and beams direct and ambient audio, immersing listeners in crystal-clear vocals and rich instrumentation.” Apple said using multiroom audio with AirPlay, users can say “Hey Siri,” or touch and hold the top of HomePod to play the same song on multiple HomePod speakers, play different songs on different HomePod speakers, or even use them as an intercom to broadcast messages to other rooms. Aside from working as stereo speakers, the HomePod can also playback Dolby Atmos audio from an Apple TV 4K. As before, you need the same HomePod model to create a stereo pair as the first and second generation cannot be paired together. Apple said with Sound Recognition, HomePod can listen for smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, and send a notification directly to the user’s iPhone if a sound is identified. “The new built-in temperature and humidity sensor can measure indoor environments, so users can create automations that close the blinds or turn on the fan automatically when a certain temperature is reached in a room.” Apple said users can also intuitively navigate, view, and organise accessories with the redesigned Home app, which offers new categories for climate, lights, and security, enables easy setup and control of the smart home, and includes a new multicamera view. The new HomePod design is largely unchanged but the new model is slightly shorter than before and a bit lighter.  It comes in two colours – white and a new lighter gray midnight variant, both of which ship with colour-matched power cables, which are now removable. The second generation HomePod is priced at $299 (R5,179) same as the original model’s price when it was discontinued. It is available to order today and will be available on 3 February .
