Marumo Gallants are understood to have given head coach Dan “Dance” Malesela the next few games to turn things around at the club or pack his bags and go.ALSO READ: Folz is a better coach than Benni McCarthy, says AmaZulu boss Sandile Zungu Gallants are sitting at the foot of the DStv Premiership and when “Dance” was brought in, management were confident that he could be their saving grace. However, Gallants are still struggling under Malesela and he might be booted out if the results don’t come. “Dance knows that it is never personal when it comes to football. He has a good relationship with management but football is a results driven game and so far he has not delivered. The team does not want to lose its status at this point because once you go down, it is really hard to come back up. Something different has to be done because survival not up for discussion — the team must stay in the top flight” said a source. Malesela’s next three games are not going to be easy as he plays against fellow strugglers Golden Arrows on Wednesday. After that, Gallants will host Soweto giants Orlando Pirates who are high in confidence after thumping Stellenbosch FC 4-1 this past weekend.  The following week, Gallants will take on top four hopefuls Sekhukhune United. According to Phakaaathi sources, if Malesela loses all these games, it will be curtains for him at the club.
