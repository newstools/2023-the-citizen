During the briefing, Mbalula said this year’s festive season was characterised by a sequence of long weekends that contributed to increased traffic on the roads across the country and as a result, 1 451 people lost their lives. “We also recorded a 6,5% reduction of fatal crashes compared to the previous year when we recorded 1 295 fatal crashes compared to 1 211 this year,” he said.
