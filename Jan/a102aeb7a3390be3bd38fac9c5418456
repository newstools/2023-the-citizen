SuperSport United new signing Zukile Kewuti is delighted to have joined the Pretoria outfit and says he can’t wait to work with coach Gavin Hunt. ALSO READ: Zwane gets compliment from former Swallows player Kewuti was unveiled as Matsatsantsa’s new signing on Tuesday, with the midfielder signing for the Spartans following his exit from KwaZulu-Natal based club Maritzburg United. The 27-years old midfielder has also had stints with other DStv Premiership sides AmaZulu FC and Cape Town City. “Firstly, I would like to thank the SuperSport United technical team for trusting and believing in me. I am very excited and overwhelmed to join this young and energetic team,” said Kewuti. “Coach Gavin is an ambitious coach and I’m looking forward to working with him and making a contribution to the Spartans.” It was at Cape Town City where the hard-tackling player cut his teeth in the South African football professional ranks after impressing in the development structures. His fine displays for Cape Town City saw him get a loan move to Usuthuand he went on to impress again in the AmaZulu team. Kewuti left the Mother City club back in 2021 for a fresh start with the Team of Choice, but things didn’t really work out  for him. He will be eager to get his career back on track at SuperSport, but it won’t be simple for him to break into Hunt’s starting line-up. Competition for a place in the starting XI will certainly be more intense with their central midfield consisting of the likes of former Orlando Pirates player Siphesihle Ndlovu and Grant Margeman who is on loan from Mamelodi Sundowns. Ndlovu and Margeman have been a very consistent pair for SuperSport in midfield, and their contribution in the team is one of the reasons the club has been doing well this campaign. Matsatsantsa are in second spot on the league standings with 27 points from 14 matches and they trail Sundowns by seven points.
