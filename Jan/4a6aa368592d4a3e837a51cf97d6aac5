Former Miss South Africa Cindy Nell Roberts has shared tips for people looking to lose weight, especially when so many want to do so as a New Year’s resolution.   The now businesswoman is also a TV presenter, CEO and charity director of the non-profit organisation called Women4Women which is focused on female empowerment, community upliftment and youth education.  Not only using her platform to empower women, Roberts shares tips on her health and fitness over the last few years. She revealed that she had been receiving a lot of queries from her followers and fans on weight loss and why fasting didn’t seem to work for them. Intermittent fasting has become a popular diet trend over the years. It involves people eating at different widow periods by voluntary fasting and non-fasting over a given period. The rule of thumb is that you have to leave at least 12 hours between meals before your next meal.  Most people assume fasting will help them lose weight quickly, however, Roberts debunked parts of this myth.  “Ladies. All the messages I’m getting saying “I’m not losing weight” but I fast but I don’t get around to exercise. My darling darling friends. YOU WILL NOT lose weight sitting on the couch. Zero! I exercise every weekday or close as possible to it.  “Write down what is most important to you, and if being healthy is not in the top 3 then ok. Netflix and chill babe. And don’t be hard on yourself, if it is, then move [your body] – make the time. Cancel what is on the list at [number] 5-10. It took me almost two years. And consistency. And weight loss is just a bonus. Health and wellness is the main goal. And BTW exercise is so much fun!” she wrote.
