Home-team Scarlets proved too clinical for the Bulls when they edged the Pretoria side 37-28 in their United Rugby Championship clash in Llanelli on Friday night. In an entertaining match, which also had plenty of errors, in Wales which finished with both teams scoring four tries, it was the home side who prevailed but not before being given a big fright by the Bulls. After scoring the opening try early in the game through scrumhalf Zak Burger, the Bulls almost immediately lost their grip on the match, allowing Scarlets to dictate matters and open a big lead as the minutes ticked by. Before no time it was 27-7 to the hosts, but before the break the Bulls were able to score a second try through wing Stravino Jacobs, who crossed in the corner after some good play by his team, to give the tourists some hope at the break, at 27-14 down. Then, midway through the second half, the Bulls, now on top, scored their third and fourth tries by Cyle Brink and Simphiwe Matanzima to get them to within two points of the Scarlets, who’d only added a three-point penalty in this time. Scarlets though, desperate to hang on for the win on home soil, scored their final try late on by Johnny McNichol to end the Bulls’ ‘comeback’ and they prevailed 37-28, but not without a scare. Chris Smith converted all four of the Bulls’ tries, while Scarlets kicker Sam Castelow slotted three conversions and three penalties, while Dan Jones also slotted a conversion. Scarlets’ tries were scored by Dan Davis, Kemsley Mathias, Gareth Davies and McNichol.
