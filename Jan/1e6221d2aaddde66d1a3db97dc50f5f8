Italy’s National Cinema Museum has given Oscar-winning Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey an award, it emerged Tuesday, just days after he appeared in court in Britain accused of sexual assault. Accepting the award on Monday in Turin, the 63-year-old thanked the museum “for having had ‘le palle’ (the balls) to invite me tonight”, according to Deadline and Variety reports..  The museum, which also organised a masterclass with Spacey, hailed the actor as “unquestionably among the most talented and acclaimed actors of his generation”. Its “Stella della Mole” award was given to Spacey — the star of the Oscar-winning film “American Beauty” and drama series “House of Cards” — for his contribution to filmmaking by junior culture minister Vittorio Sgarbi. Spacey on Friday appeared via video link in a court in London to deny charges of committing seven new sexual offences against a man in Britain in the early 2000s.
