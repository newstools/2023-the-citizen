The Blitzboks kicked off the Sydney leg of the World Rugby Sevens series on a winning note after they beat Kenya 31-5 in their opening pool match on Friday. The SA Sevens team led 21-0 at the break and scored a further two tries in the second half to seal the deal. The South Africans were clinical on attack, but it was their defensive effort that impressed most, as they kept Kenya at bay with solid tackles and then attacked from turnover possession. Kenya had possession in the opening minute, but were bundled into touch. The Blitzboks won the lineout and with a deft inside pass by Ryan Oosthuizen, Shaun Williams was allowed some space. The scrumhalf ran hard and transferred to Shilton van Wyk, who ran in from 50 meters out to score under the poles. Ricardo Duarttee converted for a 7-0 lead. Williams started at scrumhalf, with Duarttee at flyhalf and the latterâ€™s playmaking ability handed Van Wyk, at centre, a quick brace as a lovely delayed pass opened the Kenyan defence up. Duarttee converted for a 14-0 lead. Williams scored the third try with a lovely stop and go catching the Kenyan defence flat-footed. The 21-0 scoreline was a fair reflection of the match at that stage in Sydney. The second half saw some changes from coach Sandile Ngcobo and one of those replacements, James Murphy, was first on the second half scoreboard, again after strong tackling by the men in green and gold forced Kenya to make mistakes under pressure. Credit to the Kenyans though, who kept attacking when in possession and they were finally rewarded two minutes from time when Kevin Wekesa found some space on the outside. Kenya managed to keep recycling the ball and worked their way up the field until their winger was in space. The Blitzboks were not finished though and Siviwe Soyizwapi scored his 140th World Rugby Sevens Series try after a slick backline move and a 31-5 final scoreline. The Blitzboks next face Uruguay (12.44am) and New Zealand (6.49am) on Saturday to wrap up pool play.
