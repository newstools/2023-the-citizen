Bulls boss Jake White has named 10 Springboks in a strong squad for the team’s United Rugby Championship match against the Dragons in Wales this weekend. The squad of 28 will arrive in the UK later this week for the match at Rodney Parade in Newport this Friday, with kick-off at 9.45pm. “We have another three away games this January. This is the block that is toughest for us, playing six out of seven games on the road, so things aren’t getting any easier but we just have to make sure that we improve every week,” said White on Monday.

After this weekend’s match the Bulls return to Loftus Versfeld for a Champions Cup match against Exeter on January 14 before returning to the UK for a fixture against Lyon, in the same competition. They remain in Europe for a URC clash with Scarlets before returning home again.
