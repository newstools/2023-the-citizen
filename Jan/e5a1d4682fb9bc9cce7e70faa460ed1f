As the Mainland Tanzania NBC Premier League hots up, analysts have divided the 16 participating clubs into four groups based on their performance. One group comprises three clubs whose chances of winning the league are high. The second group is made up of clubs that aspire to be among the four top finishers in the league’s standings. And, while another group of four clubs is struggling hard to avoid relegation, the four clubs in the fourth group are virtually lackadaisical—not really caring whether they win trophies or not—as long as they remain in the Premier League! In any case, players, officials, and fans of several of the clubs have been complaining about what they described as “poor refereeing and other forms of match officiating.” This, they say, has been playing merry hell with their performance on the soccer pitch and the scoreboard. Indeed, the Tanzania Premier League Board and Tanzania Football Federation are on record for acting against some football officials, including referees, who violate the game’s rules and regulations. The (Mainland) Tanzania Premier League is ranked by Fifa among the ten top Leagues in Africa, and in the top 100 globally. We all should, therefore, do our best to preserve and even improve that reputation.
