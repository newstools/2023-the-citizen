BEST BET RACE 6 SWINGER: 1-SANTA THERESE WITH 3-AND WE DANCED. These two look a division above the other four runners in this feature race over 1600m. Also, because there are only six runners, there is only one Swinger, which in effect, is what used to be called a Dupla. That means they need to run first and second but in any order. VALUE BET RACE 8: NO 8 SILVERY BLUE – EACHWAY This runner would be hard to beat if he had a decent draw, but as he is drawn widest of all he has been priced up at 8-1. In-form Louie Mxothwa rides and hopefully he will be able to overcome that hurdle but barring any disasters, he should run on well into the places.
