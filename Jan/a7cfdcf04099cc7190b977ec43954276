The Lions suffered a 33-3 defeat at the hands of Munster in a United Rugby Championship match in Cork on Friday night, a result that will give them little confidence ahead of a tough January in Europe. The Joburg team were coming off a big loss to the Stormers and while they had their chances to score more than a penalty, poor finishing and uncertainty about how to play smart tactical rugby in poor weather cost them in the end. The Lions enjoyed their fair share of possession and had the wind at their backs in the first half, but failed to capitalise. The home team were 12-3 up at the break and then cut loose in the second half, scoring a further 21 points. In the end Munster scored five tries while the Lions had to settle for the sole penalty. Where the Lions failed to make the most of their chances, Munster took most of their opportunities and played the conditions better.
