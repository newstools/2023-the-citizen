Dar es Salaam. Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) recorded Sh2.77 trillion in tax collections in December 2022, the highest monthly collection recorded since the authority was formed in 1996. According to a statement released on Sunday, January 1, 2023, by the Commissioner of TRA Mr Alphayo Kidata, the December collection was 106.5 percent above the target of Sh2.6 trillion. The December collections conclude a good performance for the taxman in the first half of the fiscal year 2022/2023 according to the authority.   From July to December 2022, the taxman has collected a total of Sh12.46 trillion which is 99 percent of its Sh12.48 trillion target. The impressive first-half performance, according to Mr Kidata, was attributed to the rising willingness among the public to pay taxes; improved relations between the authority and taxpayers; timely resolution of issues, and the current growth of business and economic activities in the country.  “No matter how successful we have been, it is still important to increase tax collections by improving the willingness of taxpayers to pay taxes,” Kidata stated in part adding that this will enable the government's capacity to provide services to its citizens, including security, infrastructure, and social services.
