Even though he hasn’t played much for Orlando Pirates this season, striker Terrence Dzvukamanja played a crucial role in helping the Buccaneers register their first win of the year.

But his introduction into the game as a second half substitute paid dividends with the score-line reading 1-1, only for Dzvukamanja to score the teams second goal in additional minutes, before Vincent Pule  wrapped up the tie with his second of the match to help Pirates win 3-1. Dzvukamanja was happy to have made a huge impact in the game for the Soweto giants. “As a team, we take it like, if someone is playing, we support each other. And when things are not going well, the coach tries to do things (make plans), I came on to support the team and make the fans happy. That’s why I scored,” said the striker. “I am very happy to have scored in a crucial moment like this because we needed the win. So, before I came on, I told myself ‘Terry you have to push, and you have to find a goal so that the team can win’.”The Zimbabwean international will be hoping for more game time after the Arrows win.  The Buccaneers have now collected 22 points in their last 16 games as the team looks to climb up the league standings.
