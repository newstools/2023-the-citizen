I thought it was a very good match and over all we deserved to win,” said the Sundowns head coach after the game. “Richards Bay pushed us, they are number three on the table and are very difficult to beat. “A lot of teams struggle to come here and pick up points. I thought in the first half we were exceptional. We ran out of legs a bit in the second half, but sometimes the team has to suffer together. “When you suffer together it helps you in games where you do not have the legs. You have to trust each other and be there for each other.” The Sundowns head coach insists that there is still plenty of room for improvement in his side, even though they are on such an impressive run. “There is a long way to go, we are not there yet,” he added. “We gave a lot of chances to Richards Bay to score, especially in the second half, and we are not a team that usually does that. So there is a lot to improve but congratulations to the players.”
