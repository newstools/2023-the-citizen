Dar es Salaam. Jubilee Health Insurance has unveiled two health schemes that are specifically designed to cover the elderly and children. The products dubbed J Care Senior and J Care Junior are targeting the elderly aged at least 61 and the children aged between zero to 17 years. The Jubilee Health Insurance executive director, Dr Harold Adamson, said the two products were introduced in response to customer demands and support the government in providing health insurance for all. “We believe that by covering these underserved particular populations, our products will help tackle some of our society’s health-care concerns,” he said, adding that Jubilee was the first company to introduce such services. He said that the company backs the government’s attempts to implement its Universal Health Insurance goal. According to him, J Care Senior is designed for the senior citizens from 61 years and above. The coverage includes senior health clubs, lifestyle management programmes and health screenings. On the other hand, J Care Junior covers all children including those with underlying conditions such as sickle cell and cardiac issues. The government is preparing a Universal Health Coverage (UHC) law with the Bill expected to be read in Parliament for the second time on January 31, 2023, with the new arrangement expected to come into effect on July 1.
