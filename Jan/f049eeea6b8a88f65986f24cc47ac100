Simba, who recently exited the Mapinduzi Cup, travelled to Dubai last Saturday for a week of training with new head coach Brazilian Roberto Oliviera alias Robertinho.

The team’s camp in Dubai comprises 38 people. Simba’s information officer Ahmed Ally stated yesterday that they intend to play against formidable teams from Dubai, which would be revealed later by their hosts. Ally said the team’s players have begun intensive training, which includes not only gym sessions but also on-field training such as skills and strategies. He added that the team members are staying at The Arabian, a well-known hotel in Dubai, courtesy of honorary president Mohammed Dewji. “We are staying in a world-class hotel with all training facilities, such as a gym and other amenities. So far, the players are performing well in training, and we will begin playing friendly matches in a few days.” he said. “Our timetable indicates that we will play two matches,” Ally explained. He went on to say that Robertinho and the rest of the technical bench are pleased with the camp and feel it will reflect the team’s success in both local and international games.
