Former British prime minister Boris Johnson likened Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the “fat boy” character in a Charles Dickens novel on Thursday, saying he wanted to “make our flesh creep” with his nuclear threats. Speaking in Davos, Johnson said Putin wanted to present the war in Ukraine as a “nuclear standoff between NATO and Russia.” “Nonsense. He’s not going to use nuclear weapons. He’s like the fat boy in Dickens. He wants to make our flesh creep,” Johnson continued. “He wants us to think about it. He’s never going to do it,” he added. “Fat boy” is a character in Dickens’ first novel, The Pickwick Papers, who appears to delight in scaring a trembling old woman by telling her “I wants to make your flesh creep.”  ALSO READ: Russian soldier killed after deserting military base Johnson argued that Putin would never use nuclear weapons because “we put him into a complete economic cryogenic paralysis” and that using them would lead China and India to turn against Moscow.

We need to help them to win as fast as possible,” Johnson said. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.
