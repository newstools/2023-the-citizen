The Joburg Super Kings face a hard task making the SA20 semifinals and they will now have to grit their teeth even more as they say ta-ta for now to left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso, who has been their best bowler. Phangiso, Joburg’s leading wicket-taker in the competition and also the most economical of their frontline bowlers, has been found guilty of bowling with an illegal action during the Super Kings’ match against the Pretoria Capitals on January 17 at the Wanderers. The 39-year-old took 4/32 in that match, despite Jimmy Neesham depositing him for three successive sixes in his final over. Read more: JSK spinner Aaron Phangiso reported for suspect bowling action Phangiso was initially reported by the match officials and an independent bowling action panel comprising experienced match referee Zed Ndamane, CSA head of high-performance Vincent Barnes and former Proteas bowling great Vernon Philander formed the same opinion. While Phangiso was allowed to keep bowling after the initial report and picked up another four-wicket haul four days later in the win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape at St George’s Park, he has now been suspended. Joburg Super Kings have requested a proper analysis of his bowling action at an ICC-accredited centre, and if his action is shown to be legal then Phangiso will be able to resume playing. The former Proteas spinner was previously reported for throwing in 2016, but he quickly remodelled his action and has been considered prim and proper through many overs on the domestic scene, with the same umpires standing as in the SA20. Sri Lankan mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana filled Phangiso’s role admirably on Tuesday night, taking 3/30 in his four overs against Durban’s Super Giants at the Wanderers.
