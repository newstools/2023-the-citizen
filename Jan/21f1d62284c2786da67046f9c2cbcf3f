Many of our boys have attained results that exceeded their own expectations. The boys have produced a stellar set of results and we congratulate the class of 2022 on their excellent achievements. “The matric final results are the culmination of 13 years of hard work and they are a nod to both the boys’ unyielding efforts, their parents’ unequivocal support and the determination of their teachers,” said Jeffrey. St Benedict’s top student Danny (Yan Ming) Gao produced a set of results that are unmatched. His 93.57% average is even more awe-inspiring when you consider that he achieved 100% in Maths and notched up a total of 11 distinctions. Gao was just 3% shy of a 12th distinction.  The 18-years-old’s formidable subject lineup included: English (95), Afrikaans (90), Information Technology (IT) (93), Life Orientation (LO) (96), Life Sciences (LS) (90), Mathematics (100), Science (91), Music (77), Statistics (88), Calculus (81) English (86) and Mandarin (99).

The Grade 7 Piano exam is for candidates who have extended their advanced level of playing. Gao is passionate about actively making a difference in the world and he hopes to pursue a career that will help him do just that. His heart is set on studying either medicine or IT this year. Following closely on Gao’s heels was Magna Cum Laude Blazer recipient, Thashil Mistry, who clinched a full house with 10 distinctions to his name. His overall average was an incredible 92.86%. Mistry too had a heavy workload and finished with: English (90), Afrikaans (94), IT (96), LO (95), LS (87), Maths (96), Science (92), FSM Stats (82), FSM Calc (81) FSE (82). Mistry is not just academically proficient, this all-rounder walked away with a string of awards during his final year, including colours for Music, Oratory and he was the debater of the year, among many more accolades. Both Gao and Mistry feature on the IEB outstanding achievers list: Top 5% nationally in six subjects and a distinction in LO. They also both achieved results in the top 1% nationally within a subject. Of the 113 boys who sat the final exams, 26 bagged an overall average that exceeded 80%. Two pupils, Keaton Muller (90.86%) and Tiago Matias (89.71%),  received eight (8) distinctions across a broad spectrum of subjects. Seven boys, Yabsira Gebrermichael (89.29%), Turidu Di Bella (89%), Nicholas Mostert (88.43%), Xavier Prospero (88.29%), Nicholas McDonald (87.86%), Joshua Sammons (86.43%) and Chidiebere Umah (86.29%), achieved seven distinctions. The impressive results show no signs of the many challenges the pupils faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic in grade 11 and the first half of their grade 12 year, Jeffrey says. “Our matriculants are now on the cusp of the next chapter of their lives. They will join the other old boys who have passed through the gates of St Benedict’s – among them many notable achievers.  “Over the years we have produced great sportsmen, advocates, judges, businessmen, entrepreneurs, philanthropists and values-based men and we are confident that we will see great things from these new old boys,” said Jeffrey.  St Benedict’s College hopes that the class of 2022 will go on to forge happy and successful lives, while making the world better for their place in it, Jeffrey added.  “They have certainly been well equipped to move forward with confidence as they become the trailblazers of South Africa’s future success.” NOW READ: ‘Easier said than done’ – Goal-driven Jody’s good exam results required sacrifice
