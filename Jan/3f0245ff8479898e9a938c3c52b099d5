DOUBLE FLOAT 2-JOHNNY’S HOPE AND 6-GREENBACKCURRENCY WITH 1-AGAMEMNON AND 3-BOOK OF DREAMS The two floating bankers should fight this out but this is a small, weak field and something could sneak into the first two. The cost of this bet is R12. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 6 OUR EMILY – EACHWAY We did well at Turffontein yesterday when Zuzan won for us, paying R10.40 for a win and R3.10 for a place. While this bet is unlikely to yield as big a return, with trainer Michael Roberts in top form and Rachel Venniker claiming her 1.5kg allowance, Our Emily is expected to contest the finish.
