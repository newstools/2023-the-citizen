A small group of residents in Sonland Park, near Vereeniging, are up in arms about potholes and have taken the initiative to repair the craters themselves. Potholes have become a serious problem in several parts across the country, causing extensive damage to cars. The are believed to be about 25 million potholes across the country. However, some residents are taking action to makes roads driveable for motorists. Speaking to The Citizen, Sonland Park resident Elmarain Botha said they are fed up with the potholes. “We are fixing the road, the potholes, because the municipality fails to fix them, so our cars get damaged. We are fixing it for all the residents here in Sonland Park and Falcon Ridge, everybody that uses Langrand Road.” Botha said they are digging into their own pockets to fix the holes in the roads.  Her husband Dawie Botha said they have so far spent more than R1 200 buying concrete and cement to patch up the craters. While the solution may be temporary, Botha and the group of residents urged the municipality to repair the potholes, which affect their daily commute. “I wish they can drive this road on a daily basis, especially the one by Skippie Botha, it’s very dangerous because the cars veer out and can hit other cars. Not only that, but the cars get damaged, the tyres and the mags.” ALSO READ: WATCH: Man claims son almost drowned in massive pothole In August, Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula rolled out a what the department of transport called a 16-month labour intensive programme, spearheaded by the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral), to address potholes in the country.
