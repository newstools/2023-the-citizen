Orlando Pirates coach Jose Riveiro is adamant that the last two games the club won will help them grow as a team, especially since they managed to score seven goals in those games, something that has been a huge problem in the Bucs team.

With the goals coming and the club climbing the log, Riveiro is happy to finally see his charges finishing their chances. “It’s normal, it is a scoring game. We are looking for goals and it is what the people enjoy the most. Happy to finally break that wall in the second halves- to increase our level of confidence. Two different games we played here at home, two games in a row and two different scenarios and different approaches from the opponents. But I think that is going to help us to grow a lot as a collective,” said Riveiro. The Bucs coach says they have been enjoying getting more time between their games this month, but he knows that games will be coming thick and fast the following month. With that in mind, Riveiro says it is important for him to prepare fully and wants to see consistency from his club.
