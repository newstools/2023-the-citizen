Brandon Truter was happy as his Sekhukhune United charges registered their first win in four games against neighbours Marumo Gallants on Tuesday, with the Babina Noko mentor praising his players for their efforts. ALSO READ: Pirates need to shape up with tricky fixtures ahead Truter only joined Sekhukhune late last year, with the former AmaZulu FC and Swallows FC coach replacing Kaitano Tembo as the head coach of the Limpopo based side after a string of poor results. The game against Gallants was only Truter’s second official match in charge of the club and they went on to register a 3-2 win against their rivals in the DStv Premiership. Truter says it was a great way to start the year for his team and he dedicated the victory to the club’s supporters. “I am just happy that we could kick the year with a win, but it was a massive shift from the boys, especially Tlotlo Leepeli, Nyiko Mobbie and my two centre-backs as well. I am also not surprised but very happy with my substitutes that came in. They contributed immensely – Abednego Mosiatlhaga, Given Mashikinya, Ellias Mokwana … and Samy Seabi, they were all magnificent. “I would like to dedicate the win to the supporters. I hope they keep on celebrating with the three points.” Truter began his spell as Sekhukhune mentor in the team’s last game of the year, where he had to go up against his former side AmaZulu and the two teams played to a goalless draw. The win against Gallants should be a morale-booster for the Sekhukhune coach and his charges going into their next fixtures, with the team aiming to climb up the league standings. They will be looking to register their second victory of the year when they take on Kaizer Chiefs at FNB Stadium on Saturday.
