Kaizer Chiefs lost a third DStv Premiership match in a row on Saturday and coach Arthur Zwane is now under real pressure.  ALSO READ: What Kaizer Chiefs can expect from Basomboli But Amakhosi will not be discouraged too much by their 1-0 loss to runaway league leaders Mamelodi Sundowns at FNB Stadium on Saturday night.  Zwane’s side stood tall against an unforgiving Sundowns, who are on a run of 12 Premiership wins in a row and are on an unstoppable charge towards a seventh league title on the spin.  Neo Maema was the hero for Rulani Mokwena’s Sundowns with the winner, just as a he was on Monday in their 1-0 win over SuperSport United.  Masandawana will feel a little lucky to have taken the three points from Amakhosi, who threw everything at them on Saturday. Sundowns started well and showed their intentions on the game early on.  Just five minutes into the game, Themba Zwane’s effort hit the woodwork, with Itumeleng Khune in the Amakhosi goal already beaten.  Sundowns’ persistence in attack finally paid dividends in the 20th minute when Neo Maema finished off a great team move to give the visitors the lead.  After that, Amakhosi had their chances in the opening period and could have found the equaliser but they just could not find the right pass in the final third. The second half took on the same pattern with Sundowns not too worried and happy to take their time on the ball. Chiefs took charge but were perhaps to hurried in their approach and still could not find a way to seriously threaten  Sundowns also had opportunities to extend their lead but could not take them.  Sundowns are now 17 points clear at the top of the standings with just over 10 games to the end of the season. With this being Chiefs’ third loss in a row, even though they put up a fight, Zwane will be under pressure and fans will be on his back demanding a change.
