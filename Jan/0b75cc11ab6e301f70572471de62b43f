Stormers boss John Dobson has made four changes to his side for the Champions Cup encounter with London Irish in Brentford on Sunday. Kick-off is 3pm SA time. There are two changes to the pack and two in the backline, along with a few positional switches, for the return clash with the English Premiership outfit. Lock Connor Evans will make his first start for the Stormers, while in the loose trio Junior Pokomela is at blindside flank. In the backline Angelo Davids comes in for the injured Leolin Zas and a fit-again Ruhan Nel joins Dan du Plessis in midfield, with Damian Willemse at fullback.
