From the start of the season he has been growing and he keeps doing it. It is what we have to aim for with him and he is responsible to keep that process going. If he is in this mood and (playing with) this spirit, he is unstoppable.  “It is also about the team to get him in these positions .. and also the intuition of an individual like Rashy is to create chances.”  Rashford’s next chance to continue his scoring streak could come on Saturday as United host english Championship side Reading in the fourth round of the FA Cup.  Ten Hag’s side then have the second leg of the Carabao Cup semifinal against Forest on Wednesday, before their English Premier League campaign resumes on February 4, with the visit to Old Trafford of Crystal Palace.
