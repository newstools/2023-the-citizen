I am not making excuses, but I know what I am talking about. We have the players, they are quality players, hence I say that Pirates can match Sundowns.” With their second loss in a row, the Sea Robbers went further down league table. Sundowns are sitting nicely at the top with 37 points, while Bucs are on 19 halfway through the season, “The league is still fresh, there is still a long way to go, it is not a sprint, but a marathon. I believe in the players that we have and I believe they can challenge Sundowns. It is not by chance that we won the MTN8, we did it because we have the players. When it comes to the league, it is about consistency, I think that is one thing we are missing. Once we become consistent, you will see what I am talking about.” Jose Riveiro’s side will  be aiming to get things right when they meet Golden Arrows at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday.
