All three changes come as the result of concussions picked up in the win against London Irish last week, with Junior Pokomela, Paul de Wet and Manie Libbok all unavailable for selection. Springboks Herschel Jantjies and Evan Roos will both make their return from injury via a replacements bench which also features flyhalf Jean-Luc du Plessis and hooker JJ Kotze. Coach John Dobson said that the team are looking forward to what should be a great occasion at Cape Town Stadium. “This has all the makings of a Champions Cup classic, with a place in the play-offs at stake and we want to do it justice,” said Dobson. “Three concussions in one week poses a bit of a challenge for us, but we are keen to see what impact the players coming in can make. “We are also obviously delighted to have players of the calibre of Herschel, Evan, JJ and Jean-Luc back in the mix off the bench, so there is a lot to look forward to on Saturday night,” he said.
