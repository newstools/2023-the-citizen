Singer Lisa Marie Presley, the only daughter of rock and roll legend Elvis Presley and Pricilla Presley, has died at the age of 54. Her death comes hours after she was hospitalised following an apparent cardiac arrest. They were shocked by Lisa Marie’s death, the family said in a statement. “Priscilla Presley and the Presley family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Lisa Marie. They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone and ask for privacy during this very difficult time,” the family said in a statement. According to AFP, entertainment website TMZ reported that Elvis’s famous daughter was in an induced coma on life support, and that she had been “unresponsive” when her housekeeper discovered her at her home Thursday morning in the celebrity-studded Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas, entertainment website TMZ reported according to AFP. Her ex-husband, Danny Keough, who also lives at the property, performed CPR until paramedics arrived and transported her to the hospital. Lisa Marie was last seen at the 2023 Golden Globes alongside her mother to support Austin Butler, who took home the award for best performance in a drama for his portrayal of her father in Baz Luhrman’s Elvis. She called Butler’s performance “mind-blowing” in a red carpet interview with Entertainment Tonight. “I really didn’t know what to do with myself after I saw it,” she said of Baz Luhrmann’s movie. “I had to take, like, five days to process it because it was so incredible and so spot-on and just so authentic that, yeah, I can’t even describe what it meant,” she said. Like her legendary father, Lisa Marie had a passion for music and put out three records of her own throughout her life including To Whom It May Concern in 2003, which was certified gold, Now What in 2005 and Storm & Grace in 2012. Elvis Presley died of cardiac arrest in August 1977 at the age of 42. ALSO READ: ‘Stage 6 is a serious struggle for SMMEs’ – Tbo Touch
