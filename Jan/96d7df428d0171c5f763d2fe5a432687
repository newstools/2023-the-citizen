The win took Bucs to fourth spot on the league standings, with the Soweto giants now having collected 25 points in 17 games. The Buccaneers had a perfect start to the match, with the hosts getting a goal in the first eight minutes of the match through a well taken header by Thabang Monare from a set-piece. In the 15th minute, Stellies had a good chance to level matters through the pace of Deano van Rooyen on the right side of their attack, but his cross was cleared by the Bucs defence. Pirates would go on to get a second goal of the match to make things much harder for Stellenbosch, with Innocent Maela scoring after a failed clearance by the visitors’ goalkeeper Sage Stephens in the 22nd minute. Stellenbosch were found wanting most of the time, and Bucs could have easily gone into the break with a third goal, especially with Bandile Shandu’s attempt, but he was denied by the crossbar. The second half wasn’t that different, with Bucs striker Kermit Erasmus finally making it 3-0 with a good strike in the 60th minute, before Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo scored the fourth goal for the hosts a couple of minutes later with a well taken shot from outside of the box. Stellenbosch did manage to get a consolation goal through Mervin Boji in the 74th minute. The loss against Pirates marked a ninth game since Stellies last won a match, and they have now fallen down to 15th place on the league standings. Stellenbosch have only registered 17 points from 18 league games.
