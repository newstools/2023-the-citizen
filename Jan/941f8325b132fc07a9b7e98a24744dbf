BEST BET RACE 2 – SWINGER: 8-AXEL COLLINS AND 9-LAZY GUY On form Lazy Guy should win this but he is a five-year-old who has already raced 22 times but he has been close up In his last few races and this is a week field. As a result, the Swinger looks the safer bet and Axel Collins does appear the main danger. VALUE BET RACE 6 No 10 AQUABOLT – EACHWAY Proven form at Scottsville is always an advantage and Aquabolt has recorded a win over this course and distance. He ran a close-up fourth last time behind Ishnana over 1100m as well at Socttsville and it looks as if he is running into form.
