Springbok captain Siya Kolisi has given a heartfelt address to the players of the SA20 team, the Paarl Royals. In a video doing the rounds on social media, Kolisi is seen addressing the Royals players in their change-room, presumably after Sunday’s round-robin defeat by his “home team”, Durban’s Super Giants. Kolisi and a number of Sharks rugby players attended Sunday’s SA20 game at Kingsmead cricket ground in Durban. Wearing a Super Giants shirt and joining in the huddle, Kolisi is seen in the video clip where he introduces himself to the Paarl players and tells them a bit about who he is. England’s Eoin Morgan and Jason Roy, of the Paarl Royals team, flank Kolisi. He goes on to thank the players for their contribution in giving South Africans something to smile about during the current tough times in the country, including daily load-shedding and joblessness. He adds the SA20 players’ effort to give something back is appreciated, calling it “special”, and further says “you win some and lose some” and tells the players to “enjoy the tournament”.
