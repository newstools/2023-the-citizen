Actress and singer Anlia van Rensburg took to her Instagram account on Tuesday afternoon to congratulate her hunky fiancé, Springbok lock, Eben Etzebeth on receiving the award for ‘SA Rugby Player of the Year’. Anlia shared two photographs of her and Eben – the big rugby player kitted out in his Springbok formals wearing a wide grin, proudly holding his trophy in one hand, and his other arm around his beautiful fiancé’s waist. In the first photograph, Anlia admiringly beams up at her rugby player fiancé and in the second one she rests her head on his broad chest holding the one side of Eben’s award. “Congratulations! SA Rugby Player of the Year. I am extremely proud of you my soon-to-be husband. You are absolutely an inspiration and deserve everything beautiful in life. Love you,” the blonde captioned her Instagram post dedicated to her future husband’s success. The couple who got engaged in March 2022 met in Melkbosstrand, a coastal village north of Cape Town, in October 2021. Eben didn’t waste any time and proposed to Anlia five months later on her birthday. From a recent Instagram post, we believe the couple will be getting married in the Cape Town area this coming weekend.

Anlia has also been keeping busy making waves in the music industry with her new single Plaaslewe.
