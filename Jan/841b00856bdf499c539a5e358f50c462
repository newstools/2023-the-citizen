An ordinary episode of BBC’s ‘Match of the Day’ got a bit raunchy when regular programming was interrupted by sex noises. Presenter Gary Lineker managed to keep a straight face and ignore the pornographic audio that started playing over the commentary. The show was unpacking the latest FA Cup match between Wolves and Liverpool when the loud and exaggerated moans of a woman being sexually pleasured drowned out Lineker.

Huff Post later reported that the audio had been a prank, revealing the loud moaning noises were caused by a hidden mobile phone “taped to the back of the set”.
