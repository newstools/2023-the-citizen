Zwane and Chiefs were embarrassed by AmaZulu this past week, who thumped them 4-0, with fans calling for the head of Zwane. “When the appointment was made, the club knew that Zwane is a rookie coach in the DStv Premiership and they could not place too much expectation on him from the outset,” said the source. “Maybe from next season, his performance will be watched a lot more closely. Look at Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, for an example. The club owners gave him time to lay the foundation for his team and now they are doing incredibly well in the English Premier League. It’s all a matter of time,” the source said.Zwane has been at the helm of the Glamour Boys since May last year and his league record reads: seven wins, three draws and six defeats.  The man known by the nickname “10111” during his playing days, has struggled to transfer his form and success as a player to his new life as a head coach.
