As Orlando Pirates prepare to host Stellenbosch FC at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday, Bucs assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi says it is important for the club to be consistent and get maximum points.  ALSO READ: Folz is a better coach than Benni McCarthy, says AmaZulu boss Sandile Zungu Pirates head into this game on the back off a good victory against Golden Arrows, where they ended up winning 3-1 at home last weekend.  With that in mind, especially since results weren’t really impressive prior to their clash against Arrows, Nickazi wants the Pirates players to go out there and fight for maximum points, but he is well aware that they are coming up against a Stellenbosch side that is well-coached. “It is another opportunity for our team to fight for points, we are playing against a fully energetic and well-coached Stellenbosch team. We will want to get the points, build on the consistency, build on the performance of the previous match,” said the Buccaneers assistant coach. “It is important that we become that team … the consequences of us being consistent will give us points. It is a fight, a never-ending fight.” The Soweto giants were inspired by a determined performance from Monnapule Saleng, who gave the Arrows players a headache in their last match, with the forward making an assist and scoring one of the three goals. A win for Pirates against Stellies will be crucial, and Ncikazi knows very well they need to collect as many points as they can in order to get higher on the league table. At the moment, Pirates are in eighth spot on the log, with the side having collected 22 points from16 matches.  Getting a win in this tie will see them jump to fourth place, where they will unseat Sekhukhune United, who are on 24 points.
