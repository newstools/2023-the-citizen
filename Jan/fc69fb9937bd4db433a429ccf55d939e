Dar es Salaam. Ride hailing company, Uber has resumed operations in Tanzania after a nine-month suspension. The companies were forced to suspend services in Tanzania following the government’s regulatory changes that were enforced effectively from April, 2022. Uber ceased its operations on the April 14, 2022 citing ease of doing business as the reason why it couldn't continue serving the Tanzanian market. According to the company, it noted that the Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) had created stiff regulatory policies that made running a smooth business operation in the country, impossible. “We have made the difficult decision to suspend our services in Tanzania from Thursday 14 April 2022. The guide fare set by LATRA has posed significant challenges for systems like Uber to continue to provide services to our customers," the company said then in a statement. It added: It becomes increasingly difficult for us to continue providing services. We will not be able to provide services until the environment becomes friendly for us to continue providing services. Read:What is the fate of Uber, Bolt as uncertainties rise?
