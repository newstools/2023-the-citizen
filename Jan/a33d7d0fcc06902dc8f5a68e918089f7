“Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka,” popularly known as Ukhozi FM’s Song of the Year feature has become a mainstay in South African pop culture and people seem to look forward to arguing with the choice for top song.  This year was no different as social media blew up with arguments over what song should have taken the top spot.  This year, Ukhozi FM crowned Big Nuz’ Ngeke featuring DJ Yamza Song of the Year. However, most people have flooded social media with the opinion that K.O’s SETE featuring Young Stunna and Blxckie should have been number one and not number six. Other argued that King Monada should have topped the list.

Each year, as people mark the New Year, they also check whether or not their favourite songs from the previous year have been given the recognition they feel the song deserves.  2022 has been a good year for musician K.O. whose genre-bending track SETE has been dominating the charts since it was first released in August.  Sete IS song of the year! End of story. https://t.co/yyXNu2Oufh— Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) December 27, 2022 According to Spotify, the song claimed the title of the most streamed song in Mzansi beating out popular songs like Paris by Q-Mark, Glass Animals’ Heat Waves, Wanitwa Mos’ Dali Nguwe and Lost Frequencies’ Where Are You Now. “South Africans showed the most love to K.O’s hit track SETE. It received the most likes via the heart button. ‘Liking’ is how you tell Spotify that you’re into a particular song, album or playlist,” explained the streaming service.  Ingoma Ehlukanisa Unyaka #UkhoziFMTop10 No. 06K.O ft.

Sadly, it was also the year that the group lost yet another member when Mandla ‘Mampintsha’ Maphumulo died of a stroke on Christmas eve. Big Nuz now only has one surviving member, down from three members.  ‘ NGEKE’ . Is song of the year. Absolutely deserved I’m afraid . ????????— Danilo (@odedanilo) December 31, 2022 [WATCH] DJ Tira says he has asked uKhozi FM to donate all the votes for his top 10 nominated song 'Sikilidi' in the Song of the Year category, to Big Nuz's 'Ngeke Ngivume' in honour of Mampintsha. #Newzroom405 pic.twitter.com/7H1dxGLxC4— Newzroom Afrika (@Newzroom405) December 29, 2022 1: Big Nuz ft.

This thing of having Big Nuz in KZN and Monada in Limpopo must come to an end. Take us back to the times of Brenda Fassie, DJ Sbu, Mafikizolo, etc.We want one song!— Khutso Mamabolo (@LKMamabolo) December 31, 2022 SETE – 21 million views  AYE KUWA – 3.2 million views NGEKE – 1.9 million views It’s obvious Sete is #SongOfTheYear.Go argue with Ukhozi and Thobela FM pic.twitter.com/DCab75Fwc7— Liso Black (@Owami_Dlamini) December 31, 2022 In KZN, Sete wasn't going to be the song of the year. If it wasn't going to be I Ngeke, it would have been ingoma kaMaskandi. Y'all think a hip hop song was going to be the song of the year in KZN? Be for real bafethu????— MaLih (@Janet_nzabe) January 1, 2023 Whoever doesn’t believe that King Monada won song of the year Aye kuwa yowo ????????#SongOfTheYear— Wanga Ramuhuyu (@wanga_ramuhuyu) December 31, 2022 READ NEXT: K.O basking in the success of his hit single ‘Sete’
