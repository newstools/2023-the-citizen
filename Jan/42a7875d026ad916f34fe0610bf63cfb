Local celebrities flocked to radio veteran Mark Pilgrim’s social media pages on Tuesday, after he shared that he returned to the hospital.  Pilgrim has been battling cancer since it returned last year after 33 years in remission. The Hot 102.7 FM radio presenter has kept fans and followers updated on his journey to fight the disease.  However, his latest update set off an alarm amongst concerned followers, including several celebrities wishing Mark a speedy recovery.  Posting a picture of himself in a hospital bed, Mark looked starkly skinnier, the radio host admitting to his drastic change in appearance.  He wrote: “Really skinny at the moment. Having more fluid drained from [my] abdomen so my tummy has a bit of space for food. It’s a journey. It’s not easy. Baby steps. Still have the end goal in sight where myself, Adrienne and the girls are walking on the beach with our future golden retriever”.  Celebrities such as international DJ Black Coffee, DJ Fresh, politician Fikile Mbalula, Pabi Moloi, Lalla Hiryama, actress Zenande Mfenyana, Leanne Manas, and Olympic Gold Medallists Roland Schoeman sent Mark plenty of love and urged him to keep fighting.  SABC 2 Morning Live host Leanne Manas wrote: “Let that dream keep you fighting! You are amazing Mark”.  Black Coffee said: “You got this Mark.” Just a day before, Mark shared that he was still receiving his treatment at home. He said he was receiving a four-hour drip with his puppy by his side and that he was seeing improvement in mobility.  “Getting a 4 hour drip at home is a lot easier when a little fur ball is keeping me company.  “Still out of breath doing the smallest things, especially with drainage tube still in my chest, but walking a little further each day without my cane for support. #dontstopbelieving,” he wrote.   Mark was enjoying time with his family during the holiday season and reading Prince Harry’s memoir Spare.  READ NOW: Mark Pilgrim gets to hug his daughters after weeks in ICU
