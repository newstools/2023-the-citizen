Sharks boss Neil Powell has been forced to make a few changes to his side for Saturdayâ€™s Champions Cup match against Harlequins in London. Springbok hooker Bongi Mbonambi is injured, as is Boeta Chamberlain while Makazole Mapimpi is banned (for two weeks), which means the Sharks have a somewhat new-look about them this week. In all their are five changes to the side that beat the Bordeaux Begles in Durban last Saturday.   Coming in for Mbonambi and Chamberlain are Kerron van Vuuren and Aphelele Fassi respectively, while in a rotational switch, Phepsi Buthelezi and Sikhumbuzo Notshe swap jerseys, while Curwin Bosch is back for Lionel Cronje after the flyhalf was a late withdrawal from the Bordeaux game after pulling up short during the week and not healing in time. The final change sees Thaakir Abrahams in for Mapimpi. Harlequins came from behind in the first-round match at Kings Park in December to threaten what would have been a rare away win in the tournament but were denied by the Sharks who are now looking to make it back to back wins against the London-based side. Although the Sharks have already qualified for the round of 16 courtesy of their three straight victories, a win will guarantee them a home clash in the next round.
