South Africans are thirsty for live entertainment, with everyone wanting a slice of the good life. Despite initial complaints about tickets being too expensive, seats are flying and two more dates had to be added to Kevin Hart’s Reality Check tour due to popular demand. What started out as one show at the SunBet Arena at Time Square in Pretoria has quickly grown to include two extra dates at the Pretoria venue. Tickets for 17 and 18 February are sold out, but tickets for a third show on 19 February went on sale earlier this week.
