The Blitzboks powered into the Cup final of the Sydney Sevens tournament on Sunday when they beat Fiji 31-12 in their semi-final in the Allianz Arena. The South Africans beat Ireland in their quarter-final and went through the pool stages unbeaten as well. They got the better of Kenya, Uruguay and finalists, New Zealand, in Pool B. Sandile Ncgobo’s team will take on the Kiwis in the final later Sunday, at 11.20am. The Blitzboks were simply too good for Fiji, scoring their first try early through Shilton van Wyk and then added tries by Dalvon Blood and Jaiden Baron to lead 17-0 at the break. The South Africans matched strong defence with physicality and quality offloading to completely outplay Fiji in the first half. Fiji, desperate to not be blanked, started the second half strongly and scored first to get back into the contest.  But, a poor pass by Fiji in midfield, which ended with the ball on the ground, was hacked ahead by Darren Adonis and it sat up perfectly for the South African to collect and dive over for his team’s fourth try. And then from the restart, a Fiji pass was perfectly read by Van Wyk, who intercepted and scored his second try of the match. Fiji scored a late, second, consolation try, but it was the South Africans who had too much for their opponents and now have a chance to win the Cup final in Sydney.
