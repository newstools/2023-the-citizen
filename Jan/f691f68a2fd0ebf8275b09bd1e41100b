Just six months out from the Netball World Cup, which will be played in front of their home crowd for the first time, head coach Norma Plummer is hoping the Proteas make full use of the Quad Series competition starting in Cape Town this weekend against the world’s top three teams. Ranked fifth in the world, Plummer admits the SA side will need to be at their best when they open their 2023 campaign with a Quad Series match against New Zealand on Saturday, but she is confident they have the ability to make a statement in the build-up to the global showpiece, also to be held in the Mother City later this year.

I think we have a chance to cause a few upsets.” Plummer got an opportunity to assess the depth of the national squad in November when the Proteas and an invitation SA Presidents XII both went unbeaten in their matches against lower-ranked Scotland and Zimbabwe in the Diamond Challenge series in Pretoria. After a short December break, the squad reassembled this week, and Plummer was eager to showcase their ability during the Quad Series tournament against Australia, England and New Zealand, as she looked to continue refining her squad for the World Cup.
