A 43-year-old Cape Town woman has been arrested after she was found with 30 000 mandrax tablets worth approximately R1.5 million. The suspect was nabbed on Thursday after the police’s Anti-Gang Unit members reacted to intelligence at around 3.40pm and conducted a search operation at a residence in Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain. Police spokesperson Colonel Andrè Traut said the woman was expected to appear in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate’s Court on Monday, on charges of dealing in drugs. “Our investigation surrounding the circumstances of the arrest and seizure are still underway and the possibility of more arrests is not ruled out,” Traut said in a statement. Earlier this week, police arrested a 58-year-old Manenberg woman after she was found with a consignment of drugs apparently destined to be delivered to inmates at a prison. Police spokesperson Captain Frederick van Wyk said the suspect was arrested on Monday after police received a tip-off about contraband that would have been smuggled into Voorbrug Prison. “The members executed a search at the indicated premises in Bevan Street, Greenhaven, Manenberg and seized 385 mandrax tablets, 10kg of dagga, five grams of cocaine, 10 cellphones with batteries and 35 sim cards,” Van Wyk said in a statement.
