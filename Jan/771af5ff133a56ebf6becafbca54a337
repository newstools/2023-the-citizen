At this point, it was alleged that the suspect would offer the lost woman some assistance, and in doing so, he would lure them to a secluded area. The suspect would then rape and rob the victims of their belongings. Police also confirmed that one of the victims was hacked with a panga during the incident. In a statement, police spokesperson, Colonel Malesela Ledwaba, said: “The suspect also targeted women hitchhiking on the R71 road on the way to Phalaborwa and Giyani.
