World Cup-winning tighthead prop Frans Malherbe has signed a three-year contract extension to continue his stay with the Stormers. The experienced No 3 has only ever played for one team in his professional career and will continue to add to his 126 Stormers caps over the next three years. Malherbe came through the junior ranks in the Cape, representing Western Province at U16, U18 and U19 level before making his Stormers debut as a 20-year-old in 2011. Since then he has established himself as one of the most respected front row forces in rugby, who has delivered consistent world-class performances for both the Stormers and Springboks. While he is renowned as one of the best there is at scrum-time, Malherbe also offers considerable value in his positional play, defensive nous and general rugby intelligence. After representing the Stormers for over a decade, Malherbe played a key role in the team’s victory in the inaugural United Rugby Championship last season. Stormers coach John Dobson said that having a player of Malherbe’s class remain loyal to the team is hugely significant. “Frans embodies what we would like this team to be all about. He is already a Stormers legend and will only add to that in the years to come. “He is a world-class player who contributes so much more to our cause than just what he does on the field. “He will play a vital role in inspiring and showing the next generation what it means to be a true Stormers man,” he said.
