Police in Jinja have detained at least 20 supporters of English Premier League football side, Arsenal, over a trophy parade on the city’s streets following the club’s 3-2 defeat inflicted on rivals, Manchester United on Sunday. Bukayo Saka’s goal and an Eddie Nketiah brace gave the premier league leaders victory over the Red Devils at the Emirates Stadium with the winning goal coming late on in the match after a VAR intervention. Marcus Rashford and Lisandro Martinez netted for United in the pulsating match that set Arsenal five points ahead of title chasing Manchester City.   A day later, police intercepted a group of jubilant Arsenal fans who were driving in a convoy of about five vehicles as they attempted to join Iganga Road from Main Street.
