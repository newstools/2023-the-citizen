Bongo flava star Diamond Platnumz has been once again called out on social media for wearing a knockoff luxury timepiece. Diamond, who has a penchant for showing off expensive jewellery, took to Instagram recently to stunt his luxury watch, a Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711. The problem, however, is that the 5711 Nautilus is a rare timepiece whose production was discontinued in January 2022. Today the watch is valued at around $180,000 (Sh421.75m), nearly 4 times its original retail price. Diamond probably thought he had fooled his fans but hawk-eyed watch enthusiasts were quick to point out that he was flaunting a fake timepiece. One fan went the extra mile, sending the picture of Diamond and his watch to Fake Watch Buster, an Instagram platform where the authenticity of luxury watches is ascertained. “@diamondplatnumz in our opinion that’s a fake Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711.Wrong shape of the case, wrong bezel shape and size, wrong shape of the dial, rehaut (inner frame) is too deep, wrong shape and size of the date window, wrong shape and size of the crown and wrong shape of the bracelet links etc.,” the account details.
