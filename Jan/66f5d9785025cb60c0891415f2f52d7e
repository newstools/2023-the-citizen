Pirates scored first through Deon Hotto, but the home side made a comeback with Juan Zapata getting the equaliser a minute after the half hour mark, before Darwin Gonzalez put the Mother City based club in the lead later in the second half. Chaine, who joined Pirates prior to the start of the season, says they have to analyse the game as players and look at what they have to do better to get positive results going forward. “It was not one of the best games because of the result, but nevertheless we can only get better from here. The feeling is great, it is a big club, a big responsibility. But like I said, we can only get better. As a team, I think we should bury our chances, because we create a lot, not just today(Saturday). If we can convert our chances then we can be better,” said the former Bloemfontein Celtic goalkeeper. “Individually, you have to look back at the whole 90 minutes and look at what you can do and improve as a player.” The loss top City was Pirates’ second defeat in a row having also lost to Mamelodi Sundowns. Pirates will be looking to get things right when they welcome Golden Arrows at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday.Arrows will be another huge test for Jose Riveiro’s charges, with Abafana Bes’thende having enjoyed some decent results.
