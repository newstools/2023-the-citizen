After failing to get promotion at the Sasol National Women’s Championships held in Limpopo last year, TS Galaxy have bought their way to the Hollywoodbets Super League by buying the status of Vasco da Gama.

It is a dream come true for the club. We are a Club that is unapologetic in its stance towards the advancement of the football game amongst women of this country. It has been a critical part of our agenda to have our lady’s side competing in the elite league just like the men’s side,” said Sukazi. “Our ladies performed with outstanding honour at the regional level but unfortunately, that pursuit was unsuccessful in the national playoffs for two seasons on the trot. We were left with no choice but to make other means of securing Hollywoodbets status and we’ve just done exactly that.” Sukazi thanked club president and husband Tim Sukazi for believing and supporting her vision. “We want to thank our president Tim Sukazi for supporting my vision. He is someone that believes in women’s empowerment in this men-dominated business. In addition to TS Galaxy Queens, we have our Cheerleading Program which is an educational programme that caters for girls from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is a programme that we have been running with conviction since its inception in 2016 while our Club was campaigning in the third division,” she added. “We regard ourselves as the global brand. If you see top clubs in the world they all boast women’s sides. I’m talking about the likes of PSG, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Arsenal, and Barcelona. I hope more PSL teams will follow suit for the proper advancement of the sport amongst our women.”
