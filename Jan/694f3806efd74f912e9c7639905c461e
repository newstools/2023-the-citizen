Ndumiso Mabena’s lack of game time at Orlando Pirates is because still needs to adjust to the Bucs system, an insider in the Bucs camp has revealed. ALSO READ: Riveiro says Pirates technical team doesn’t sleep in defeat Mabena has not played a single competitive game since he was announced by Pirates just before the resumption of the DStv Premieship after the break for the World Cup.  The veteran striker trained with the Buccaneers for weeks prior to that, but was only signed just before the resumption. “Look, I know everyone has been asking why Mabena is not playing, but the thing is you just can’t put anyone in the team to play,” said a source.  “Remember that it’s a team, we have a system and the coach has a plan. He has to understand how the team plays and that’s when he will get his chance to play. “He is a very mature person. He knows what the coach wants and he has been one of those players who are very vocal when the team does bad, that’s what the coach likes about him.  “Even at training, he is always giving his best to show that he wants to play. You will soon see him playing, and I think there will be a lot of goals coming from him,” said the source. Mabena returned to Pirates after he left another DStv Premiership side, Royal AM, following a sour relationship with the club. He was unveiled as a new signing together with Craig Martin, who joined the Sea Robbers from Cape Town City.
