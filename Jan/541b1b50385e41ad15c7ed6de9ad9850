In a feat not seen for a number of years, South Africa’s new vehicle sales ended 2022 as it started it with a positive increase in December across all the various segments. A result that translates to 12th months of consecutive increases despite record fuel price hikes, the flooding of Toyota Motors South Africa’s Prospecton Plant in April, as well as the continuing knock-off effects of the global semi-conductor shortages, rapidly rising costs of living, crippling load shedding, plus Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, the resilience of the local market saw it post its third highest overall figure of 528 963 vehicles since 2019’s 536 612.

Despite the ongoing difficulties abroad and locally, the association said it expects 2023 to be similar to 2022, but with smaller percentage increases as a result of projected lower economic growth. It also remarked, “A key priority focus for the South African government in 2023 is to finalise the support framework for new energy vehicles, considering the importance of timing of the interventions so that they were aligned with investment decisions and lead times of the OEMs when considering next-generation models”. Out of the country’s best performing automakers, Toyota kept its position at the top in December with sales of 11 250, followed by Volkswagen (5 331), Suzuki (3 058) and Hyundai (2 770).
