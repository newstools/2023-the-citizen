With his experience of playing abroad in England, the US and Netherlands, the midfielder is aiming at imparting his knowledge to Sekhukhune players for the benefit of the team. “I am obviously expecting a lot after being abroad for over a decade. I know the league is very unpredictable and so, it is my responsibility to adapt as quickly as possible and adjust whenever I need to. I am looking forward to the challenge. I know there are differences from where I played and the PSL, but at the end of the day football is football and it is a challenge,” said Mokotjo, whose football career began at SuperSport United development. “I think my role will be very broad in the team when it comes to motivating whoever is playing of course, sharing my experiences. Also not verbally but also physically, when we are in training or in games, just to be an example, I have a lot on my hands.” Mokotjo added that he felt very welcomed by Sekhukhune and he can’t wait to meet his new teammates. “But I’m obviously at a club that is striving for consistency and they are testing their limits, so I think it is a good environment for me to be in. I am looking forward to meeting my teammates, so far I have received a warm welcome, that is all that matters.”
