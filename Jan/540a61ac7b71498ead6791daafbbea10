Czech top seeds Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova successfully defended their Australian Open women’s doubles crown on Sunday to extend their dominant Grand Slam streak.     The pair outgunned Japan’s 10th-seeded Shuko Aoyama and Ena Shibahara 6-4, 6-3 to post their 24th straight win at a major after triumphing last year at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open. “A big thanks to my partner Barbora,” said Siniakova. “I’m so happy we did it again, it was a nice journey. Thank you for playing with me.” ALSO READ: Sabalenka wins Australian Open for first Grand Slam crown It was their seventh Slam title to make them only the fifth women’s team in the Open-era to claim so many.
