Royal AM chairman and midfielder Andile Mpisane is said to be considering hanging up his boots before he even makes his debut in the DStv Premiership.  None of the coaches, past and present, have shown any faith in the 21-year-old, and his dream of playing in the top-flight might never be realised.  “Football needs a lot of commitment and discipline,” said a source.  “The coaches always tell him that if he wants to play, he needs to be fully invested in the daily routines of the team.” ALSO READ: Malesela still with Gallants but ‘never asked for leave’ Mpisane, a recording artist, appears to have given up on trying to bully his way into the team, which is what led to the departure of coach Dan “Dance” Malesela. Mpisane, the golden boy of business woman and owner of Royal AM, Shauwn Mkhize is  one person who is used to having everything come his way without much effort, if his social life is anything to go by. He owns a fleet of luxury cars and lives in a multi million rand mansion. This explains, to a certain extent, why he would not be necessarily keen to make the effort of getting in shape and being fit for selection in his own club, as he is the chairman of the club named after him. Word has it that the 21-year-old demands to be part of the team but coaches at the club have always told him to do things the right way. A teammate of his, as Mpisane is registered as a player in the PSL, has labelled the father of three, as a “lazy bum” who wants to ruin the team with “silly” demands. The socialite made only one appearance on the bench in a 1-0 loss to Richards Bay. “Why do you think coach Dance left? He was tired of his behaviour. Why did John Maduka feel like he needed a change?” added the source.  “The boy does not take football seriously because one night he is at ebumnandini (places of entertainment) and the next moment he wants to be in the team. They told him to retire and focus on running the team since there is no chief executive officer anymore.”
