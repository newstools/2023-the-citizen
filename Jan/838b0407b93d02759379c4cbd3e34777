Coach John Dobson has completely overhauled his Stormers team for Friday night’s United Rugby Championship match against Ulster in Belfast, with kick-off at 9.35pm. Prop Ali Vermaak will play his 50th match for the Stormers while fit-again Evan Roos, who played off the bench last weekend, is back in the starting team. Also, Jean-Luc du Plessis will wear the No 10 jersey for the first time this season with Manie Libbok still out, and he’ll have exciting Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu next to him in the No 12 jersey. In the front row Vermaak is joined by JJ Kotze and Brok Harris, with Scarra Ntubeni on the bench. Marvin Orie will captain the Stormers side and resumes his lock partnership with Ben-Jason Dixon. New recruit Ruben van Heerden is in line to make his Stormers debut from the bench. Also, Clayton Blommetjies is at fullback and is joined at the back by wings Suleiman Hartzenberg and Cornel Smit. Veteran centre Juan de Jongh makes his return on a replacements bench that also features Herschel Jantjies and Kade Wolhuter.
