BEST BET RACE 4 NO 3 BRAVE VIKING – WIN Piere Strydom and trainer Joe Soma teamed up with a winner at the Vaal on Tuesday and they can do it again with Brave Viking. He has by far the best form in the race and with the scratching of four rivals, he looks a standout bet. VALUE BET RACE 8: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 3-MIGHTY GODESS AND 4-SOLO DIVA WITH THE FIELD Once you look past the top two in the betting, then anything can run into the money. If you get a roughie winning the race this could really pay well. The full cost of this bet is R1080 but you can take from 1% (R10.80) upwards.
