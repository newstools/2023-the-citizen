Dar es Salaam. Tanzania’s up and coming chess player Mahek Desai (13) has been inspired to continue doing the best in the game after recording the best results in the just ended East Africa Junior Chess Championships held in Kenya. Mahek, who is a student at the Aga Khan Academy School in Mombasa, Kenya, emerged the winner of the 14 age category after collecting four points among seven chess players from various countries. Speaking with The Citizen, Mahek, who is also a good swimmer with Dar es Salaam Swim Club (DSC), said the event was very tough and each player targeted silverware. She said the secret behind her success is good training in the game and good support from her parents for her daily activities including studies. “I’m inspired after winning the first position in my category. All the players were targeting to do the best too. I am very happy to promote my country, Tanzania, as well as my school in the competition,” said Mahek. She said she will use the results as a tool to achieve more in the game. “Hard work and following all instructions from my coaches were the key to this success. “I can say that the victory is a challenge to me to defend my title well because other chess players will be targeting to do the same in the coming event,” she said. Just like other players, Mahek   developed chess interest from her peers and her coach known as Louis. Mahek’s father Dharmesh Desai said they feel proud to see their daughter having  performed impressively in the competition and won the title. According to Desai, Mahek was previously named as the runner-up, but after her points were recounted, it was found out that their daughter won the first position in the 14 age category. “We are very happy with the results and we will continue to support her in all her careers. She is also a swimmer, who is  doing her best,” said Desai.
