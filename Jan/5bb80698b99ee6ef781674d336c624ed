With his contract coming to an end by the end of this season, Orlando Pirates midfielder Thabang Monare says he doesn’t need to wait for the end to prove what he is capable of in order to be considered for an extension. ALSO READ: Maritzburg announce new signings including Pirates’ Peprah Monare, who has only made seven appearances for the Sea Robbers, was initially without a club at the beginning of the season after Bucs decided against renewing his contract, but it eventually renewed for one season. The 33-year old now finds himself in a similar position now that his deal with Pirates is coming to an end. “To be motivated is an everyday thing for me. I don’t really have to wait for my contract to come to an end to prove what I am capable of doing. That would be like cheating the game. It’s just an everyday thing (to be motivated), a weekly thing, where you always push yourself to be a better player than you were the previous day,” said Monare. “As a footballer, you should be motivated every day, seeking improvement on a daily basis.” Pirates have not been at their best since the return of domestic football following the Fifa break late last year. The Soweto’s giants form has taken a nosedive, following defeats to Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City. Monare explains that there is a bigger picture at the club since they are still working to find their identity with a new coach Jose Riveiro, who joined prior to the start of the season and new players. “Sometimes you focus on the results and do not look at the bigger picture. Then you end up losing a team that might be dominant in the future. We must understand that we are a team that wants to find a new identity and that’s going to take time and hard work. It’s just a matter of time then everything will be fine,” he added. Monare, who featured in Bucs last clash against City will be crossing his fingers to make the starting line-up again when they host Golden Arrows at the Orlando Stadium on Saturday.
