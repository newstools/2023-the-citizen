The striker has been out for close to six months now and she was expected to be out of action for a year because of the seriousness of the injury. Before leaving for the US week, the Banyana forward and former Atletico Madrid star says she is excited to be going to join her new team, but she has not fully recovered yet. “I can’t wait to meet with my new teammates at Kentucky but I am still going through rehabilitation from the Achilles tendon injury. I am close to full healing and at the moment am running and trying to get to full fitness,” said the Mohlakeng born striker. “The club (Racing Louisville) has been very helpful and for that I want to applaud them,” she said. South Africa Football Association president Danny Jordaan also shared his delight in Kgatlana’s move and going on to her new club and wished her the best of luck in her career. “We as Safa are very happy with Thembi’s progress and we are delighted that she is returning to the playing fields. We would like to wish her all the best in the United States as she embarks on this chapter of her career,” said Jordaan. Kgatlana, who is a former Caf Women’s Footballer of the Year, will be eager to be fully recovered especially with the Fifa Women’s World Cup coming up in August this year. The tournament will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand and Banyana will be competing at the tournament for the second time in their history.
