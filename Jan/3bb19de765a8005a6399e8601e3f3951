Stellenbosch FC reserves coach Evangelos Vellios says his side has been lacking consistency this season on their quest to defend their DStv Diski Challenge (DDC) title.ALSO READ: AmaZulu director explains Mabizela, Yeye appointmentsStellenbosch had a remarkable season last campaign, which led them to the championship title. But, a loss of their players who have been promoted to the senior team has forced Vellios to rebuild his squad. Stellies have not done as expected this campaign, with the club in fourth place on the log after registering  23 points. Vellios’ charges suffered a huge blow in keeping one leg in the race for the title after they lost 2-1 to Swallows FC in their previous game and the Stellies coach says consistency has been a major problem for his side. The Stellies coach wants his side to fix their mistakes when they take on Sekhukhune at Isak Steyl Stadium on Sunday. “Last week was another disappointing performance. We haven’t been consistent enough this season. After a win against Kaizer Chiefs at the turn of the year we were hoping to kick on, but we haven’t done that. We need to try and rectify it this weekend and get on a run,” said Vellios.

We know it’s not going to be easy in Joburg, where it is very hot and the attitude is a factor. It is going to be a tough game against a very organized Sekhukhune United, but we are hoping to put in a better performance.” DDC Saturday fixtures: Royal AM v Swallows FC Orlando Pirates v Richards Bay Sunday Sekhukhune United v Stellenbosch Kaizer Chiefs v Golden Arrows Maritzburg United v Chippa United Marumo Gallants v SuperSport United Cape Town City v Mamelodi Sundowns AmaZulu FC v TS Galaxy
