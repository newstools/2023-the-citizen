The Sharks have suffered a major blow with the news that star wing Makazole Mapimpi will miss two weeks’ of action after being suspended by a Champions Cup disciplinary panel. Mapimpi was found to have made contact with the eye area of Bordeaux Begles player, Maxime Luca, during their round three Champions Cup match in Durban a week ago. The incident is said to have happened in the 36th minute, with Mapimpi being cited by the match commissioner Brian Campsall.

The sanction for such a foul is usually four weeks, but Mapimpi’s good disciplinary record counted in his favour, with the panel reducing the sanction to two weeks. Mapimpi is free to play on Monday, 30 January. He will miss this weekend’s Champions Cup match against Harlequins in London as well as next week’s URC match against Edinburgh in Scotland.
