The North West Education MEC Viola Motsumi has condemned the torching of schools after a principal’s office and a classroom at Mothelesi Secondary School were burnt down at Shaleng Village, near Pampierstad, North West province, on Saturday morning.   At 6am on Saturday the school principal received a call from one of the pupils saying the school was on fire. Motsumi criticised the torching of the school, saying it takes the education system backwards. “I take this time to strongly condemn the torching of Mothelesi Secondary School. “Such incidents delay the delivery of quality education to the learners.  “This incident is going to exacerbate the infrastructural backlogs faced by the province. I want to call on the law enforcement agencies to apprehend anyone behind this horrible incident,” said Motsumi. Motsumi said two photocopiers, one printer, one fridge, classroom furniture and the school’s files were damaged by the fire. “I appeal to the members of the public to work with the Department of Education to protect school infrastructure as the department relies on communities to ensure that the much-needed resources are taken care of,” said Motsumi.
