KENILWORTH 14 JANUARY BEST BET RACE 3 NO ROSH KEDESH – WIN This is not an easy card but there has been strong talk about Dean Kannemeyer’s first-timer. He is well bred and the scratching of the two  main contenders who have raced before open the door for this Vercingetorix colt. VALUE BET RACE 9 NO 10 BLACK SILVER – EACH-WAY This Justin Snaith-trained on form has the beating of Time Flies who is the 3-1 favourite thanks to the weight turnover. Louie Mxothwa has been given ride and the 8-1 on offer looks excellent each-way value.
