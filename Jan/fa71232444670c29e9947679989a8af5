Dan Malesela has rued repetition of mistakes from his players following their DStv Premiership 1-1 draw with Stellenbosch FC at the Danie Craven Stadium on Wednesday.

Malesela says his troops made exactly the same mistakes as in their game against Sekhukhune United, where they ended up losing 3-2 in the Limpopo derby in their previous game. “I think we were handling the game well from the onset, just up until they scored. Yes, there were a few mistakes here and there, but not harmful mistakes. I don’t want to bash the players, but we made a mistake which really put us on the back foot again. We made the same mistake last week against Sekhukhune, which cost us the match,” said the Gallants mentor. “One thing that worries me is that we try to correct these things, we either talk about it or correct them so we don’t repeat them. But we seemingly do the same thing.” Malesela further said that he always tells his players to do simple things on the field, but he is glad that they ended up fighting back to earn a point. “What we always preach to our players is to try to be as simple as possible because simplicity helps. If you look at our notes when we attack, you will see simplicity at the top.  Sometimes we want to do difficult things, but for me it is a learning process and if we get punished … it will say to players don’t repeat these things,” the Gallants coach continued. “Having said that, one appreciates the fact that we put up a great fight when we were a goal down so that we didn’t lose. If we had more time we could have probably got the second goal.”
