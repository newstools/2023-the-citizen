The catch must be clean and the ball must not have touched anything more than the palm of the fan who catches the ball. This means that the ball cannot come off a hat, umbrella, another hand, shoulder chest, or juggled either between hands or on one hand. Due to legal reasons, in line with betting regulations, the competition is open only to people over the age of 18. READ MORE: All you need to know about the SA20 league
