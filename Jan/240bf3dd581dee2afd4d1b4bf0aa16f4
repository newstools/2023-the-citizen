Dar es Salaam. Tanzania diamond exports has increased significantly to $63.1 million (Sh147.46 billion) by November 2022, the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) revealed. This is more than seven times of $8.4 million (Sh19.63 billion) export value that was recorded in the year to November 2021. The good performance was highly attributed to the country’s diamond producer Williamson Mines which is currently under suspension. The company belongs to the parent company Petra Diamonds, which owns 75 percent of the company, and the Tanzanian government owns the remainder. The mine is an open pit operation located on the 146-hectare Mwadui kimberlite pipe, which is one of the world’s largest economic kimberlites. However, the production at Williamson has been temporarily suspended – following the breach of one of its Tailing Storage Facilities on November 7, 2022.
