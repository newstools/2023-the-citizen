Made from confectioners’ sugar, egg whites and flavouring, royal icing is used to decorate cookies and cakes. While buttercream frosting is creamy and soft, royal icing hardens which is exactly what you want when decorating your child’s birthday cookies with those beautiful butterflies and flowers. Royal icing takes between six and eight hours to dry, so if you are baking cookies for a birthday party or school bake sale, make sure you decorate them in advance so there is enough time for the icing to dry before you transport the cookies. A handy tip is to keep your icing covered with a wet cloth while you decorate your cookies as the icing will start to dry while you are still busy decorating, especially if you are taking too long with your decorations.
