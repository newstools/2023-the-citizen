Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Yusuf Maart scored what could easily be the goal of the season in the DStv Premiership in the Soweto derby.  ALSO READ: Not having our way in transfer market crippled Chiefs, admits Zwane Many felt the goal would make the list for the Fifa Puskas Award (Goal of the Year) last year but when the nominees were unveiled it was not there.  It is a big goal that he scored. He got the ball from just inside his own half in the game against Orlando Pirates, and realised Siyabonga Mpontshane was way off his line.  Maart then unleashed a long shot which sailed all the way into the empty net behind Mpontshane who was trying to track back.  It was the winner that handed Chiefs the full points on the day in this game which is the biggest in the local football calendar. When asked about this snub this week in Naturena, Maart said he was not one who dwells on things that are out of his control. “At the end of the day it is the Almighty who puts everything out there for you,” said Maart who began his career as a junior at Pirates.  “And it is something you cannot control with your own hands. You cannot be upset because you have no control over it.  “If it is not there, it is not there, there is nothing you can do about it,” added Maart who signed for Chiefs from Sekhukhune United at the start of the season.  It is understandable for Maart to want to quickly get over whatever disappointment he felt because he has a job to do for Chiefs.  Amakhosi have not been doing well of late with three defeats in a row in the DStv Premiership since the new year started.  ALSO READ: Lack of goals at Chiefs gives Sekgota sleepless nights He feels it is time to curb it starting when they meet Royal AM at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon.  “We have now had three defeats in a row… We cannot go for four, we will give everything we have because our supporters are not happy.  “We try to make them happy whenever we can and we work hard for them,” explains Maart.
