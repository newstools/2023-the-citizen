The party announced Dr Lydia’s passing on Wednesday afternoon. Meshoe, who is also the wife of ACDP leader, Reverend Kenneth Meshoe, is being remembered for her role in leading the women’s wing and South African politics.   While the cause of death is not known, the party said funeral announcements would be made in due course. “It is with great sadness that the ACDP confirms the passing of the ACDP’s first lady, Dr Lydia Meshoe, today,” the party said in a tweet.
