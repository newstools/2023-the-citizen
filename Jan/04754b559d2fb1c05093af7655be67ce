Pele scored a hat-trick as Santos beat Chiefs 6-2, while Motaung grabbed a consolation for his side. “The occasion itself was unbelievable,” recalled Motaung, talking to Kaizer Chiefs media. “We knew we are not only playing Santos but also the greatest of all players during my lifetime. They beat us 6-2 and he scored about three goals, although I was happy I also scored one! “He was an unbelievable character, on and off the field. You could not come across a more humble person, you would not have believed he was a top athlete across the world,” added Motaung. “What Pele leaves in this world is that regardless of your background or you upbringing, opportunities are there for all of us to aspire to and achieve. In simple terms if you put your heart and mind into what you want, you will succeed.
