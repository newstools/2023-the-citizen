The Cheetahs are still well in the hunt for qualification to the final 16 of the Challenge Cup, despite a tight 20-17 defeat against Scarlets at the Parc Y Scarlets in Llanelli, Wales on Friday night. It was the second loss in a row for the Cheetahs against Scarlets after they were well beaten 45-26 in Parma, where the Cheetahs are based for their ‘home’ matches in the competition, in mid-December.

The Cheetahs started the competition with a 21-16 win over Pau in France which gave them four points, and with them now on six points after three games, a win against Pau in Parma next weekend in their final pool match should be more than enough to secure their progress to the knockouts. In Friday night’s game the Cheetahs were unfortunate to be pipped by the hosts after a valiant fightback early in the second half. Scarlets scored a converted try and slotted a penalty in the first half, against one penalty from Cheetahs flyhalf Siya Masuku, which saw the hosts leading 10-3 at halftime. The Cheetahs then started the second half with a bang as early tries from hooker Louis van der Westhuizen and right wing Daniel Kasende, both converted by Masuku, saw them power into a 17-10 lead after 51 minutes. Scarlets however hit straight back with a try to wing Johnny McNicholl, converted by fullback Leigh Halfpenny to level the scores, which led to a 63rd minute penalty from the boot of Halfpenny proving to be the difference in the close match. The Cheetahs now look to their final pool clash of the competition against Pau next Sunday at the Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi in Parma, knowing that a win should be enough to see them progress to the next stage of the competition.
