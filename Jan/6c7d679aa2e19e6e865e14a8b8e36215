Cristiano Ronaldo arrived in Riyadh and was unveiled on Tuesday by his new Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr, but the Portuguese superstar appeared a little disorientated.  WATCH: Brazil pays final respects to football giant Pele  The 37-year-old accidentally said at his first press conference for Al Nassr that he was playing in South Africa, and not in the Gulf state.  Cristiano Ronaldo accidentally said he was playing in South Africa ????pic.twitter.com/2wjlh5giQ5 “For me it is not the end of my career to come in South Africa,” said Ronaldo, clearly responding to those who suggested the move to Al Nassr is simply a retirement package.  Saudi Arabia and South Africa may have the same initial at the start of each part of their respective name, but it is still more than a little bizarre that Ronaldo couldn’t pick the right country in his first presser.  Hopefully he soon realises he is in the Saudi capital and playing in the Saudi Pro League, and not in the DStv Premiership. It is unlikely, of course, that even Mamelodi Sundowns would be able to afford the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star, given that he is reportedly on a base salary of $75 million a year at Al Nassr, which could rise to $200 million annually.
