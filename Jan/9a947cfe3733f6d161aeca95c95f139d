Sibisi added that Gallants came into the game fighting for their lives since they are at the bottom of the league standings in the second round of the campaign, but, as Pirates, they had to make it a point that they give everything in the tie to get a win and he is happy that the forward are finally getting the goals. “Playing a team that’s down there (bottom of the log), we know that they are playing for their lives and we had to fight from the first blow of the whistle. I am glad we did, and we got three points. I am also glad for our forward players, they are doing an immense job. It was our Achilles heel in the first round of the season (not converting chances) , but now we are finally scoring. I am very happy for our forward players and I am also happy for the clean sheet.” The Buccaneers have now collected 28 points in their last 18 games, while Gallants have only registered 15 in their last 20 league games.
