Songstress Lira shared her first health update for the year as she has gone under the radar during her time of recovery.  Lira suffered a stroke in early 2022, when she was in Germany before she was set to perform. The stroke impacted her speech.  The award-winning singer shared on Thursday that she was on vacation, which appeared to be in the dreamy location of Mauritius. Lira is seen soaking up the sunshine on a yacht, taking in the sunset views and the sandy beaches.  She wrote: “Complements of the new year! I haven’t posted this year. My speech healing is very slow, I’m doing the best I can to remain sane. I’m still alive and well.  “I wish [you] great health, prosperity and love!”  Fellow artist Kelly Khumalo commented on the video, writing: “We will continue [to] stand firm in prayer for you”.  Other stars such as Somizi Mhlongo, Nhlanhla Mafu, Pabi Moloi and Leanne Manas shared their love for Lira and were happy to see she was enjoying the island getaway.  Somizi commented: “Listen the day [you] come back on stage [hell] is going to freeze”. This isn’t the first time Lira has taken some time off. In November she went to the Eastern Cape on a boat ride on the canal in St Francis Bay. “First time, I have been on a plane in 7 months, and I chose to go to St Francis in Eastern Cape. Here I’m on the canal cruise- it’s truly beautiful. They have exquisite restaurants – the food there is quite awesome,” wrote the singer in a caption under her video.

One of the artist’s biggest highlights last year, was receiving a South African Music Awards (Sama) nomination for her classic song Feel Good which was remixed by DJ Maphorisa.
