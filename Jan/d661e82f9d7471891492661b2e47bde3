But it was not at the beginning of the game. It started in a different way than we expected. Stellenbosch were much more aggressive in their recent games, even the last game against TS Galaxy. We expected them to come to us and use different spaces, but they were quite low and we needed to re-organise our game plan,” said Riveiro.

After that, it was different and in that moment we did everything well.” Riveiro was also glad with the way his side was able to control the game, especially at home. “We were more in control here at home this season and the more we are in control of the game, the better.” Riveiro will be looking for more of the same going into their next game against Marumo Gallants, but it will be an away clash which will be played at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.
