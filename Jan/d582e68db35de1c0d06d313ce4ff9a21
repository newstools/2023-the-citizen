Chiefs have signed Basomboli to add some firepower to an attack that has managed just 18 goals i 16 DStv Premiership games thus far this season.  Basomboli was assessed by Chiefs during the break for the Fifa World Cup and Phakaaathi reported earlier this week that he was set to join Amakhosi.  “If what we have heard he said during his trial is anything to go by, then he has a lot of confidence,” said a source. “You don’t tell the other players that you are the missing link in their team if you are not confident that you can deliver. “I hope he understands how big Kaizer Chiefs are and how much pressure comes with putting their jersey on for an official game.” Botswana international Ditlhokwe, 24, has been at SuperSport since 2020.
