It was interesting that, as the Democratic Alliance (DA) took to the streets to protest the ANC’s role in the electricity crisis, the DA-run Cape Town municipality was putting in place ways to buy power from ordinary citizens to bolster supply.  That sort of “can do” attitude contrasts strongly with that of the ruling party and, in particular, Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe, who has been actively delaying moves towards renewable energy.

Yet, in many ways, the protest yesterday will have been as pointless as the visit to Ukraine last year by DA Leader John Steenhuisen. Nothing is really going to change because of it. But, as the spin doctors would say, the optics were good.

At the same time, the violent response of some ANC Youth Leaguers “defending” the party’s Luthuli House HQ was also a metaphor for how the organisation views any criticism.  All in all, good propaganda for the DA ahead of the 2024 election. ALSO READ: ANCYL vows to stop DA from delivering memorandum to Luthuli House
