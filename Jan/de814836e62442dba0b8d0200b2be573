Dar es Salaam. The government has extended the time to verify Sim cards from January 31, 2023, to February 13, 2023. The government has announced that after the deadline, all registered but unverified Sim cards will be blocked. Mr Nape Nnauye, Minister of Information and Communications Technology, stated on Tuesday at a press conference in Dodoma that the set deadline will be the final one, urging the public to take advantage of the opportunity to verify their lines. "We will disable the numbers because there are people using other people's identities to register lines. Therefore, the lines we are going to shut down are those that are falsely registered," he said. "If you have not registered it falsely, then go and verify it. Anyone who registered falsely cannot verify it because the verification system will deny him some information," he added. Mr Nnauye noted that they aimed to remove fraudsters from the system, "After announcing January 31, 2023 as the deadline, we have decided to add another 14 days." He said the situation of fraud through Sim cards has gained momentum of late, noting that after the extended time, the government will not give another time. "If you know you haven't verified all your lines, check them within this time because there won't be another time," he said.
