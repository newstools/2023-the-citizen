The video of the incident went viral online and caused outrage from many quarters of society, with many calling it a racial attack.

This after the state revealed that it was still yet to get hold of the video footage of the incident. There were also various political parties, including the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who demonstrated outside court in support of the two teenagers and their family. The father of the two boys, Brian Nakedi, called for justice for his children. He said the boys were trying to move on from the incident and focus on their studies since the new academic year began. “We’re glad that there are further investigations and the state is very much seized with the matter, so we are in the hands of the NPA so far,” Nakedi told eNCA outside court.
