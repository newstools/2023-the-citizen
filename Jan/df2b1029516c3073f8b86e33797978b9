Should Arthur Zwane just look the other way and ignore the defensive blunders that have derailed his progress as Kaizer Chiefs coach, or put more focus on correcting them?ALSO READ: Chiefs suffer birthday blues as Sekhukhune spring a surpriseThis is a question that arises after yet another defensive folly cost Amakhosi as they went down 1-0 to Sekhukhune United at the weekend.The defence has been an Achilles Heel for Chiefs since Zwane took over as coach, after the firing of Gavin Hunt late last season.His undoing could perhaps be how he always dismisses the errors as just normal and “part of the game of football.Zwane again put his brave face on and didn’t make much of Zitha Kwinika’s blunder that led to Sekhukhune’s goal and soured the club’s 53rd anniversary celebrations.Kwinika’s attempt to play the ball across to defensive partner Edmilson Dove didn’t go well, with Vusi Mncube intercepting and running through to score the game’s only goal.Zwane gave a now generic answer to the question about how they conceded: “Sometimes these things happen…I cannot fault the boys.”But with almost 40% of all goals conceded by Chiefs this season having come from defensive shortfalls, Zwane should be worried.ALSO READ: Mosimane breaks silence on Lorch speculationSome have even suggested that he calls on the experience of Mulomowandau Mathoho to reinforce his defence.Mathoho is the only defender remaining from those who have been at Amakhosi for a long time.Zwane released the likes of Daniel Cardoso and Ramahlwe Mphahlele before the start of the season and brought in Kwinika and Dove.They have both proved to be susceptible to committing costly mistakes and so have Njabulo Ngcobo, who remains a fan favourite despite seeing little action under Zwane.In the game before the Sekhukhune defeat, where Chiefs beat Golden Arrows 2-0 in Durban, goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune had to produce some top-drawer saves.This clearly shows that their defence can be easily bypassed and needs some serious work to change club’s fortunes.While Zwane dismisses the defensive frailties, they are not something new.Chiefs’ leaky defence could well be part of the reason why the club has not enjoyed much success in the past nine years.
