Dar es Salaam. Women of reproductive age between 15 and 49 years in Dar es Salaam region are most likely to be overweight compared to women in all other regions. A new report titled National Panel Survey (NPS) 2020/21 wave 5, published by Tanzania National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicates that overall 47 percent of women of reproductive age are overweight. However the women in Dar es Salaam were the most likely to be overweight compared to women in all other areas. A significant increase from NPS 2014/15 where 38.8 percent of women were overweight. “Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health,” read part of the report. Major risk factors include the development of several chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. A resident at Mwenge who spoke to The Citizen Ms Maria Shemweta said that the lifestyle  that many women have adopted is a killer and the fact that many no longer walk as a result they become overweight. “This is not good news at all because it puts the lives of women in danger, but also it should serve as a wakeup call for those who think they are overweight to start doing exercise and reduce some of the foods that make them fat,” she insisted.
