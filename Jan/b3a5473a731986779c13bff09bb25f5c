Tristan Stubbs and James Fuller did the business at the death for the Sunrisers Eastern Cape as they pulled off a thrilling four-wicket win, with three balls remaining, over MI Cape Town at St George’s Park, for their first win in the inaugural SA20 league. Chasing 159 for victory, Sunrisers were in control as Sarel Erwee (41 off 35 balls) and Aiden Markram (50 off 35) added 92 for the third wicket to leave the home side needing 58 runs off the last eight overs. But MI Cape Town fought back superbly once the wonderfully-skilful leg-spinner Rashid Khan (4-0-23-1) trapped Erwee lbw and Odean Smith (2.3-0-23-3) had Markram caught on the midwicket boundary. Sunrisers collapsed to 109/5, and Stubbs and Marco Jansen were left needing 30 off the last three overs after outstanding death bowling from Rashid and Kagiso Rabada (4-1-26-0) saw just nine runs scored in the 16th and 17th overs combined.

Stubbs was caught behind off the first ball of the final over bowled by Smith, with five runs required, to create some extra nerves. But Fuller sealed victory with back-to-back boundaries off his first two balls. Sunrisers had sent MI Cape Town in to bat first and their bowlers gave them just the start they wanted as they sent the visitors stumbling to 52/4. Dewald Brevis struggled to 15 off 28 balls before becoming the first of off-spinner Markram’s two victims. Rassie van der Dussen (29 off 22) helped rebuild the innings with George Linde, who played a great knock in the end, lashing 63 not out off just 28 deliveries, with five sixes, to get MI Cape Town to 158/8, the sort of total they would have felt they could defend. Seamers Sisanda Magala (4-0-22-2) and Jansen (4-0-25-1) were outstanding with the ball. Spinners Markram (2-0-8-2) and Roelof van der Merwe, who conceded just 20 runs in three overs, also played a big role. Read more: Pretoria prove powerplay premise with dominant win over SEC
