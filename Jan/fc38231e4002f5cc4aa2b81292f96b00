A father has raised concerns about his son almost drowning in a massive pothole in Rustenburg, in the North West province. In the video which was posted on Twitter, a young boy can be seen immersing a stick into the pothole to determine the depth of the massive crater. The father then tells his son to remove the stick to show how deep the pothole was.  From observations, the pothole seemed to be the height of a young child. In the video, the father warned the Rustenburg municipality to cordon off the pothole. “I want to give you a very stringent warning, if you do not barricade this in the next four hours… My son nearly drowned,” he said.

The municipality said hole formed after leak was reported at Rapoo Street in TIhabane. “A water unit foreman was dispatched to assess the leak. Upon arrival on site it was identified that the top soil collapsed and exposed the pipe leak due to the pressure of the leak. The foreman proceeded to allocate the complaint to the team and the team arrived on site. The pipe leak was repaired and the excavation was barricaded,” it said.
