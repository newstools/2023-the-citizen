The Wife was once a beloved show but it seems to have become something that fans can’t help but hate-watch. Two of the main things fans have been struggling with this season are the on-again-off-again situation with Naledi and Qhawe and the illegal diamond business storylines.  The first episode of this week’s trio of episodes got off to a lukewarm start until Mqhele horrified his family by abusing Hlomu in front of everyone at family dinner. Everyone, including Naledi and Xoli.  ????Mthaniya is crying and maHlomu is also crying, this scene is just heartbreaking.????#TheWifeShowmax— ????️‍????

His two youngest brothers are struggling with getting past the entire incident.  ???????????????????? #TheWifeShowmaxAnd I can’t bring myself to stop watching le nonsense— Sdumo????

However, things weren’t going so well for him on the work front as he had to execute the Chief’s orders in his quest to deal with the Zulu brothers for stealing from him.  ALSO READ: Real Housewives of Gqeberha cast revealed Speaking of stealing, the brothers attempt yet another heist, leaving them injured as Sambulo’s wife, Xoli, came to their rescue.  This is remembering that the only cute moment #TheWifeShowmax gave me this week is when Qhawe called Naledi “Mama” and she in turn called him “Papa”.Every other thing is chaos and oh God. pic.twitter.com/nbJzb34KYZ— Temitope ???? (@Melaninpops23) January 12, 2023 During the heist, Qhawe also came face to face with Sello and only one of them was able to leave the confrontation alive. Naledi’s father, Chief Kgosi, also watched the fatal confrontation over a CCTV feed streamed live into his office.  Kgosi was also the one to deliver the bad news to Tshedi who had just strengthened the bond with her husband with a view to building their family.  After saving Mqhele’s life by tending to his injuries, Naledi asked Qhawe to tell her the truth about what is really going on with her family. He chose to lie to her again, further raising her suspicion.  Qhawe also had to stop his brothers from going over the events of the heist at dinner because Naledi was in the house and she had no idea what they were really doing.  Qhawe and Naledi's relationship is exhausting #TheWifeShowmax— Penelope Nkosi???? (@PenelopeNkosi4) January 12, 2023 The Zulu family dinner was interrupted by Tshedi who sought to confront her husband’s killer and tell her sister what her lover had done. Knowing that Naledi doesn’t often believe the truth about Qhawe, Tshedi came armed with video evidence of his crime.  She immediately chose to leave with her sister, giving Qhawe back his engagement ring in the process and telling him to forget about her for good.  @stainedglasstv_ y'all ruined sis Dudu's work I don't want to lie #TheWifeShowmax— qhaledi stan acc (@street_doppel) January 12, 2023 Thereafter, Kgosi called Qhawe to tell him to get lost once and for all and there’s no telling how the writers plan to bring Qhawe and Naledi back together after this.  The episode ended with Naledi choosing to marry Sefako and fulfilling her duty of ascending to the throne as well as the plot twist revealing Xoli’s true identity.
