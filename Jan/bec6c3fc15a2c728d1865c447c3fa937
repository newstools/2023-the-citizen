Supporting wellbeing and safety online is one of the platforms top priorities, Meta owned Instagram has announced. With the new year and that ‘back to school’ feeling, there is a lot of discussion about how it can set healthier boundaries, Instagram said. This includes the amount of time spent on social media and how users can connect more meaningfully with the people and ideas they care most about. With this in mind, Instagram has introduced new ways for people, especially teens, to manage their time and experiences on Instagram, including a “Quiet Mode” to help people focus and set healthy boundaries. The new features reflect the social media platform’s ongoing work to build things that are meaningful for young people, and that are really helpful and useful for creators, Instagram said. “These new features complement our existing tools that already help people manage their time and the content they see on Instagram. “These include Take a Break, which helps remind people to take some time away from scrolling, Sensitive Content Controls that let users decide how much sensitive content they’d like to see presented in their feed, and nudges that encourage teens to switch to a different topic if they’re repeatedly looking at the same type of content on Explore,” it said.
