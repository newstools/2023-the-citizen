This is not exactly a golden era in terms of South African footballers plying their trade in Europe, but there is certainly reason to celebrate the progress being made by 22-year-old Bafana Bafana striker Lyle Foster. ALSO READ: Zwane wants Chiefs’ new striker to hit the ground runningFoster has been the subject of transfer speculation this week, on the subject of a move from Westerlo in Belgium to English Championship side Burnley, reportedly about to happen at the time of writing. The former Orlando Pirates striker’s climb through the ranks in Europe has been a while in the pipeline, since he joined Monaco from Pirates as an 18-year-old in January 2019.Foster never quite made it as a regular in the Monaco first team an had spells at Cercle Bruges in Belgium and Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal, with limited success, before his move to Westerlo.It is here, however, that Foster has blossomed and eight goals this season in the Belgium top- flight have clearly caught the attention of Vincent Kompany, the Burnley head coach.Kompany, the former Manchester City and Belgium central defender, has previous experience with South African attacking players, having coached Percy Tau at Anderlecht, perhaps the last time Tau was truly at the peak of his powers.It is hoped he can also get the best out of Foster, should the 22-year-old join Burnley, with the Clarets in brilliant form this season and well on target for promotion to the English Premier League.Kompany’s side currently sit at the top of the Championship table, 18 points clear of third-placed Watford, with the top two sides in the table guaranteed promotion at the end of the season. The Belgian head coach also has Burnley playing slick passing football, a far cry from the more physical approach that previous incarnations have been known for. This should suit Foster’s game, and should the deal go through, Burnley will no doubt hope he can add a few goals and assists to their promotion push.The prospect of Foster making an impression in the English Premier League next season should also excite South Africans, with Tau the last Mzansi man to appear in the English top flight, though he had a very brief stint at his parent club at the time, Brighton and Hove Albion.Tau’s struggles at Egyptian giants Al-Ahly have been well documented, and while he has recently returned to training after injury, it is likely that Ahly will look to move him on at the end of theseason.Bafana head coach Hugo Broos has important Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Liberia on the horizon towards the end of March, and it remains to be seen what sort of shape Tau is in.Broos could do with a fit and firing Foster more than ever.Foster did find the back of the net for Bafana in their opening Afcon qualifier against Morocco last year, and Bafana will need more of that if they are to make it to Afcon 2023.
