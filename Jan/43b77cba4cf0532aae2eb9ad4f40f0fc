The Stormers have managed to keep rising star loose forward Hacjivah Dayimani on their books for another two years, by signing the 25-year-old until 2025. Dayimani has made a big impression since returning to the city of his birth in 2021 from Joburg and the Lions where he first made a name for himself. Dayimani starred for the Stormers in the inaugural United Rugby Championship last season, helping the side pick up the title with a win against the Bulls in the final. Head coach John Dobson said that it is great to know that Dayimani will form part of the future growth of the team. “Hacjivah is a special player who brings something completely unique to our team, so we couldn’t be happier to have him extend his contract with us,” said Dobson on Wednesday. “He keeps everyone on their toes on and off the field and is already a crowd favourite at Cape Town Stadium, so we expect that to grow even further in the seasons ahead. Dayimani said that he wants to keep developing his game with the Stormers, who’re again well-placed in the United Rugby Championship of 2022/23. “The team environment here is incredible, everyone involved is able to be themselves and express themselves, which is really important to me,” he said. “There is still so much that we can achieve together and I really want to be part of that, so I couldn’t be happier to extend my contract,” he said.
