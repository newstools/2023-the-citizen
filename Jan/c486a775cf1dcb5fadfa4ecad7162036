Sharks boss Neil Powell has opted for a second string side for the United Rugby Championship match against Connacht in Galway on Saturday. Centre Rohan Janse van Rensburg and prop Ntuthuko Mchunu are the only Springboks in the starting team — a huge contrast to the week before when a Bok-laden team ran out and beat the Bulls in Durban. Also, Powell isn’t even on tour with his team; he’s entrusted defence coach Joey Mongalo with guiding the side in the match on Saturday.

Following the match against Bordeaux, the Sharks will take on Harlequins, also in the Champions Cup, in London. Reniel Hugo will lead the Sharks in Galway, with only flank Henco Venter, centre Janse van Rensburg and wing Marnus Potgieter retaining their places in the starting XV from last week. A further six players who had roles in the matchday 23 against the Bulls have been included in the side for this match.
