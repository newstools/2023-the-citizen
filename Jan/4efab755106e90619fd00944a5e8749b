South Africa lost one of its sporting greats this week after former World Boxing Association heavyweight champion Gerrie Coetzee died on Thursday following a short battle with cancer. He was 67.  Coetzee, a gentle giant, became the first African heavyweight champion when he beat American Michael Dokes almost 40 years ago, while earlier in his career he also beat Leon Spinks – one of only five boxers to defeat Muhammad Ali.  In a career that spanned from 1974 to 1986 and again from 1993 to 1997, Coetzee won 33 of his 40 professional fights – 21 via way of knockout – lost six times and drew once, against future World Boxing Council world heavyweight champion Pinklon Thomas.

However, the “Boksburg Bomber” stunned world boxing when he knocked out Dokes with a short right hook – a blow that forced him to later undergo surgery to repair his broken right hand – in the 10th round to become the world heavyweight champion.  A biopic film on Coetzee’s life Against all Odds is currently being made. Nothing quite captures the imagination of a nation than a heavyweight champion. It will be interesting to relive all the magical moments of his career when the film is released. ALSO READ: Boxing legend Gerrie Coetzee has died
