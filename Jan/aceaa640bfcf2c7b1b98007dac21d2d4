Mosimane, however, has dismissed the reports saying he is not aware of Al-Ahli’s interest in Lorch. “If Al Ahli wants Thembinkosi Lorch, me and (Orlando Pirates) chairman (Irvin) Khoza would be the first people to know that. And nobody will know until Orlando Pirates announce the deal (has) been done,” wrote Mosimane on his official Twitter account.“If the news is true, then I am not aware of that,” he said.Lorch has been linked with a move away from Pirates this January. He has also been linked with rivals Mamelodi Sundowns. Two weeks ago, Pirates coach Jose Riveiro was reluctant to answer a question on Lorch’s prolonged absence from the Bucs squad. “I don’t speak about injured players or individual players. From the beginning of the season, it is not my role to talk about players who are not available. How can we measure that? Is there any tool to measure how much it affects us if someone is not playing for the team? I cannot answer that question,” said Riverio.
