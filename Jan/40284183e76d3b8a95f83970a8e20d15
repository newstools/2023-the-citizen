The Ghanaian, however, has had injury problems and has spent more time on the sidelines getting medical attention than on the field. A source says the club has doubled their efforts to find another credible keeper in the current window.“(Siyabonga) Mpontshane is good but you can see that age is catching up and he is very low on confidence, while Sipho (Chaine) still has some way to go before he can be a regular,” said a source. “They want a keeper who will come in and take command of the position and bring the required confidence to the whole team. We all know that when a keeper is not doing well, it filters down to the entire team and that has been the case here. “The scouts are now working overtime to try and identify a keeper who can solve this problem. They have even been given the green light to look beyond our borders for the right man,” added the source.
