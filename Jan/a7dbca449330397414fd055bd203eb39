After a defeat to Connacht last week in the United Rugby Championship, the Sharks bounced back to winning ways with a bonus-point 32-3 victory over Bordeaux Begles in the Champions Cup in Durban on Saturday afternoon.  The Durban-based franchise will probably feel the score could’ve been a larger margin against a frail Bordeaux side, but in the end they got a comfortable win and sealed qualification into the round of 16.

The Durbanites lost flyhalf Curwin Bosch before kickoff and was replaced by Lionel Cronje at No.10  The visitors had discipline issues as they received four yellow cards in the game and that made the task of pulling an upset a very tough ask.    Marnus Potgieter was at the end of Siya Kolisi’s brilliance, catching a low pass on the wing to score his first try of the game. It did not take long for Potgieter to dot down for his second two minutes later.  Bordeaux’s period of pressure on the Sharks line did not amount to much as they were only limited to a penalty goal by Maxime Lucu in the second half.    Aphelele Fassi also made an appearance for the first time since suffering an ankle injury while on SA A duty in November last year.  Scorers:  Sharks: Try – Jaden Hendrikse (2), Marnus Potgieter (2); Penalty – Lionel Cronje; Conversion – Lionel Cronje (2) Bordeaux: Penalty – Maxime Lucu
