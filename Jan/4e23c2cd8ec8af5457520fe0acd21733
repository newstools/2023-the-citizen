KwaZulu-Natal residents can expect a long stretch of hot sunny days well into the weekend and the following week. The South African Weather Services (Saws) has issued a heatwave alert for the Northern Cape, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Free State, but not for KZN. Despite this, weather forecaster Odirile Modipa said KZN residents can expect high temperatures and dry conditions well into the following week.

The coastal areas are also expected to be a bit warmer than usual; we’re looking at temperatures of around 29 to 30 degrees Celsius along the coast,” she said. Explaining why no heatwave alert has been issued for KZN, Modipa said they do not have an alert for a heat wave for KZN because the temperatures do not meet the temperature threshold for the definition of a heatwave.

Modipa said no significant rainfall is expected in KZN for the next four days, but from Sunday onwards she said there might be some rainfall in the southwestern parts of the province.
