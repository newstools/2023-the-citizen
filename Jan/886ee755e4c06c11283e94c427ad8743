Rulani Mokwena was not entirely pleased with his side’s performance in their DStv Premiership victory against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday night, even though it saw them set a new winning streak in the league.  ALSO READ: Zwane not panicking despite third loss in a row Downs have now won a dozen games on the spin after their 1-0 win over Amakhosi, and are surely strolling towards a seventh Premiership title on the spin. Mokwena, however, was slightly cautious in his praise.  “There are a lot of things I was happy about but I always tell the players that we can do more and there are a lot of things we can improve,” he said.  “When I say we need to improve, people say I am trying to be modest but even if we win 20 games in a row, we still have to get better. There is no ceiling and we have to know that because we have to make our supporters happy.” Mokwena was, however, keen to praise his team on achieving a new top flight record.  “Huge round of applause to everyone involved at the club because it has never been an individual contribution. This includes the recruiting department and that also includes the generosity of the Mostepe family who invest in our team.  “The individual qualities come to the front and we try to create structures that suit the needs and the quality of the team,” said Mokwena. Goalkeeper Ronwen Williams, who marked his 31st birthday with another clean sheet, could’ve easily been confused with Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who gets heavily involved in the build-up.  Williams was most found in an advanced position on the pitch. “The talk could be different because it is very risky to play (like that) with a goalkeeper. There are one or two situations where people could say ‘what are they doing’. But it works out for us and it is important for us because big teams must have 11 players in possession on the pitch- we try to do that with Ronwen as the starting point of our build-up,” said Mokwena.
