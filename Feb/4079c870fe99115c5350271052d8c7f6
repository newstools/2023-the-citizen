Anele White appeared in The Strand Regional court on 20 February 2023, where sentence was handed down.  It is understood that in November 2021, White got involved in a physical altercation with a 25-year-old man at a shebeen in Ezinkomeni informal settlement.  Police spokesperson Ndakhe Gwala said the 33-year-old White left and came back later with a knife which he used to stab the victim to death.  “He was arrested on the same day by Lwandle police and remanded in custody.”  “The Western Cape Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Thembisile Phathekile welcomed the judgement,” Gwala said.
