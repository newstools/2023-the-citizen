Iran’s army on Tuesday unveiled its first underground base for fighter jets designed to withstand possible strikes by US bunker-busting bombs, state media reported. The base — named Oghab 44 (“Eagle” in Persian) — can accommodate “all types of fighter jets and bombers, in addition to drones”, the official news agency IRNA said, releasing images and videos from inside the base. The exact location of the base was not revealed, but state media said it was “at the depth of hundreds of metres under the mountains”, and capable of withstanding “bombs by strategic US bombers”. In May last year, Iran’s army revealed an air force base for drones under the Zagros mountain range in the west of the country.
