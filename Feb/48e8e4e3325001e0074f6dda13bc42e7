The latest security alert by the American embassy was issued on 15 February, six days after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster on energy. Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster, to respond to the electricity crisis on 9 February. The president also said he would appoint a minister of electricity in the Presidency and the minister would focus full-time on working with Eskom to end load shedding.

After considering this alert, the organisers of the event went ahead as planned, with scores of supporters joining in spite of the terror alert.
