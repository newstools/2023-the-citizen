Phakaaathi has been tipped off that Jali is not against the idea of joining Chiefs, but would want to use his favourite squad number, 15, which he dons at Sundowns.

However, Chiefs retired their No 15 jersey in honour of club legend Doctor Khumalo. “For some it might seem as just a squad number, but these kinds of things have sentimental value for players. If Chiefs are serious about Jali, they will have to bend over backwards for him and give him the No 15 jersey, otherwise they can forget about having him in their team,” said a source close to Jali.
