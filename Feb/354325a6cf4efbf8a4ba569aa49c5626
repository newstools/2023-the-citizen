Facebook user Tom Frischke posted an impassioned plea for information about the missing person’s whereabouts. “Who can provide information on his whereabouts, who saw him last? Dear hospitals, please see if he might be with you after all! Please share and give information to the police!” Tom posted. According to Tom, all Frischke’s stuff was still at the AirBnB. “Thursday he signed up for a surf course and he never showed up. We don’t know what to do and think that he is in a helpless situation. The mountain guard and local police, as well as the Germans, are informed,” he added.
