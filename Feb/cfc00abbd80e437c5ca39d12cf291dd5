He further raised suspicions when he missed the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) lekgotla, and Cabinet lekgotla citing his family bereavement as the reason for his absence in his official apology for missing the events.  “The President will announce that Mabuza has left. I promised you that I will respect the President until I leave. I hope that those who are coming in will also respect the President,” he said in the short clip. This is a developing story.  *Compiled by Kaunda Selisho READ NEXT: Presidency won’t confirm David Mabuza wants to quit as deputy president
