Arusha. Former Tanzania's main opposition party Chadema Secretary General, Dr. Wilbroad Slaa has joined the efforts to demand constitutional reforms. Dr Slaa, Tanzania’s former envoy to Sweden, attended the rally over the weekend in Karatu, where he previously served as a Member of Parliament for Chadema from 1995 to 2000. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2010. Dr. Slaa served as Chadema’s secretary general from 2004 to 2015, when he quit his position in protest of the party’s decision to endorse former Prime Minister Edward Lowassa as its presidential flag bearer. Speaking at the rally in Karatu, where he started his political journey, eight years after he resigned from politics, Dr. Slaa promised to join hands with Chadema on the demand for a new constitution, which he said is a solution for many problems facing citizens. The meeting held at Rhotia Ward was to discuss several issues, including the water crisis in the town of Karatu. When he was given a chance to greet the Karatu residents, Dr Slaa lauded Chadema's good policies. He stated in several movements that Chadema is making he believes the party has matured and is now capable of ruling the country. For his part, Chadema Karatu District Chairman Advocate Samuel Welwel stated that they only gave Dr. Slaa the opportunity to greet residents and have invited him to the water stakeholders meeting on Monday in Karatu. However, he said, the party has not yet officially received him to return to Chadema, and if there is such a process, the matter will be decided by national leaders. But Dr. Slaa, himself, has once said that he is not a member of any political party, and despite that, he will continue to share his views and advice on various issues that are productive to the nation.
