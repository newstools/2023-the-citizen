During the State of the Nation Address (SONA) Wednesday night, acting Public Protector Kholeka Gcaleka appeared to have hit the ball out the park with her dazzling yet elegant gown. Although not much is known about her personal life since President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed her to replace attorney Kevin Malunga, her sense of style is well-regarded in politics. Her professional accomplishments include serving as the National Prosecuting Authority‚Äôs deputy director of public prosecutions under the disgraced former national director of public prosecutions Menzi Simelane and as a senior state advocate. She also served as Malusi Gigaba‚Äôs legal counsel when he served as finance minister. Malusi Gigaba was also the previous minister of Home Affairs.
