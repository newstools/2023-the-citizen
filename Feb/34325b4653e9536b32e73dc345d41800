A source claimed that the players were made to pay for the club’s overseas trip last year. “They are being deducted money from their salaries to pay for the costs of that trip,” said the source. “It was initially going to be 20% taken from each players’ salary but after negotiations, it was brought down to 10%. That is absurd because the players didn’t ask to go on the trip but it was the club’s decision and for its own benefit. I have also heard that some have not been paid their salaries for January and that things are not well in camp.” ALSO READ: Lepasa’s move to SuperSport is no surpriseTS Galaxy recently parted ways with Sibusiso Vilakazi after an alleged run in with the head coach Sead Ramovic.
