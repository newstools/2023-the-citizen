Orlando Pirates assistant coach Sergio Almenara says the use of technology has helped them to communicate with head coach Jose Riveiro, who is out on a two-match suspension.

During the game we try to impact as much as we can. The half-time break is also key but today [Friday], with the use of technology, we were able to connect with him (Riveiro).”The coach was also careful about singling out Monnapule Saleng for praise, though he has been a key player for Pirates in their recent good run.“Saleng and all the other players are all pushing for a starting position. For us all the players are important, especially for the way we’re playing.”The victory against Maritzburg was crucial for Bucs, with the club heading into the Soweto derby against Kaizer Chiefs at the FNB Stadium on Saturday.

That was our target (to win against Maritzburg). That cannot be in the mind of every player in the squad, but obviously what we were trying to do was focus on the opponents we have,” he said.“We can’t control certain things, but what we can control is the message and all the guidance we’re providing throughout the week. What we did here this week was nothing related to the Chiefs game.”The Buccaneers are now third on the log and a second-place finish is seeming plausible.
