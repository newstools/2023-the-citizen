As South Africa’s load shedding crisis intensifies, many of us won’t simply have the privilege to cook. But, with that being said, there are some quick tasty salads you can whip up for lunch and dinner when the stove doesn’t work.  The prep work for salads are quite easy, particularly if you are working with already-cooked ingredients or easy-to-eat raw ingredients.   There are plenty of proteins such as beans, lentils and chickpeas that do not need to be cooked especially when the lights are out for over four hours or more and you desperately need something to eat.  These salad recipes are satisfying, filling and healthy, not to mention affordable – exactly what we need as living costs are rising.
