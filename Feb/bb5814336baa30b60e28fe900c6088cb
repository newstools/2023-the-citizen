I don’t know what other flavours there are…” She shakes the carton as per instructions and proceeds to take a sip of the mageu. “It tastes like an entire banana that’s been blended and been put in there, not bad at all.” The video has received thousands of views with hundreds of comments from social media users who made light-hearted fun of her pronunciation of mageu. Maa-Goo 😭😭😭🤣🤣🙆‍♂️…Irish girl in South Africa 🇿🇦 #mageu @pmcafrica pic.twitter.com/ERyFEs8aka— Peché Africa 🇿🇦 (@pmcafrica) February 5, 2023 Although non-alcoholic, mageu is a traditional South African drink that is made by fermenting mealie pap. Apart from it being a tasty drink, mageu has also been used as a lunch meal replacement for years, mostly due to its reasonable price and satiating qualities. According to Bhavna Sanker, Spar’s Brand Promotions and Advertising Manager who spoke to Food and Beverage Reporter, mageu’s unique and slightly sour taste comes from the lactic acid. Sanker, however, added that commercial versions of the drink are often flavoured, sweetened and contain vitamins and minerals. According to RCL Foods website, which manufactures the Number 1 Mageu featured in the video, the drink is available in other flavours including cream and strawberry. “Widely consumed across South Africa, Number 1 Mageu serves as a perfect meal replacement or energy-giving snack,” it said.
