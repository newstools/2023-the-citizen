Dar es Salaam. The National Social Security Fund’s (NSSF) tender for the sale of its Dege Eco Village project in Kigamboni, Dar es Salaam, is currently ongoing. Mr Masha Mshomba, the director general of the NSSF, made the announcement over the weekend at the auditorium of the Tanzania Information Services (Maelezo) in Dodoma. He was speaking with journalists regarding the fund’s implementation for the financial year 2022/23. He stated that the decision to sell the project was made following an appraisal in 2020 and that the sale was expected to cover the costs incurred. “The tender was recently announced and is now being processed. The project will be sold if we are able to find a buyer who will allow us to recoup our costs, but the tender will be renewed if we are unable to do so,” he said. He stated that as the number of investors in the country grows, they will be able to purchase the project at a lower cost to the fund. According to Mr Mshomba, selling the project will benefit NSSF members and the country as a whole since it will minimise losses that the Fund would experience if it continued with it. He assured members that the fund is safe and that its value has climbed to Sh6.6 trillion in December 2022, a 36 percent increase from Sh4.7 trillion in March 2021. “This increase is due to more contributions from the members as well as earnings obtained from investments. So, this growth of the Fund proves that NSSF is strong and sustainable for the provision of social security services in the country,” said Mr Mshomba. He said that in the fiscal year ending June 2023, the Fund is expecting to collect Sh1.6 trillion from members’ contributions, which is an increase of 14 percent compared to the Sh1.4 trillion contributed in the 2021/22 fiscal year. Mr Mshomba said the earnings from investments for 2022/23 are expected to reach Sh700 billion, which, he said, is a huge amount compared to recent years where the earnings were less than Sh500 billion.
