Proteas women‚Äôs cricketers Marizanne Kapp and Shabnim Ismail have been sold for lucrative amounts at the first player auction for the Women‚Äôs Premier League to be held in India next month. The women‚Äôs version of the IPL will consist of five teams, namely Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Capitals, Gujarat Giants, UP Warriorz, and Mumbai Indians. All-rounder Kapp was snapped up for R3.26 million ($181,000) by Delhi Capitals while fast bowler Ismail was bought for R2.17 million ($120,000) by Warriorz. Former Proteas captain and all-rounder, Dane van Niekerk, who was controversially left out of the national team for the T20 World Cup that is happening in South Africa right now because of fitness concerns, found a home with Royal Challengers Bangalore for R649,000. Big-hitting Chloe Tryon also went for R649,000, to the Mumbai Indians. WOW‚Ä¶ üôèüôè absolutely PUMPED!! Thank you.. the IPL team I supported since day one!
