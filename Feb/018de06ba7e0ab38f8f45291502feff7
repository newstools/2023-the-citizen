In a quiet corner of the Free State, private enterprise is helping to save four small towns and, in the process, give them one of the most reliable municipal electricity services in the country.  In the Mafube municipality – which includes the towns of Frankfort, Villiers, Cornelia and Tweeling – a private power distribution company has taken over distribution of electricity and billing from the municipality, which has been under administration since 2017.

The 25-year contract means, effectively, that the supply of electricity has been privatised – but not the infrastructure.  While scores of other towns around the country battle with municipal incompetence, which affects the delivery of all services, Mafube is the standout exception.
