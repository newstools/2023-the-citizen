Souttert is a traditional South African tart, not a melktert (milk tart) but a savoury tart made from eggs that resemble a quiche.  Souttert translated directly from Afrikaans means savoury tart. As it’s quite similiar to a quiche, you might be wondering what the difference between a souttert and quiche is.   Souttert is made with more flour and milk resulting in a smoother texture and it has far more ingredients in the filling. It’s a recipe popular in the Afrikaans community and traditionally has main ingredients such as ham, bacon and lots of cheese.  Just like a quiche, you can add whatever your heart desires that would make this recipe suitable for you and your family. Leave out the bacon or ham and add veggies like mushrooms, spinach or green pepper to your souttert.  This recipe can be ready within 30 minutes and can be served with a seasonal salad.
