BEST BET RACE 2 NO 1 JEWEL CAT – WIN Justin Snaith’s charge has only run twice and last time it was in a minor feature, the Non-Black Type Commonwealth Cup – where he ran on best of all to finish sixth, coming from last at the 400m mark to end up just 1.85 lengths behind the winner. He did produce the fastest 400m to finish in that 1000m race and now back in maiden company and running over 1200m, the Captain Of All colt looks hard to beat in this field. VALUE BET RACE 3: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 9-BLUE HOLLY AND 12-ONI SAN WITH THE FIELD. Blue Holly is the runner to beat while Oni San contested the Summer Coronation Plate, the Non-Black Type race for fillies on the same day as Jewel Cat. She finished just 2.75 lengths behind the winner and that form line looks quite decent as two winners have already come from it. After that it looks quite open and with two scratchings it eaves 13 runners. The full cost of the bet is R1320 but one can always take a percentage from 1% (R13.20) upwards.
