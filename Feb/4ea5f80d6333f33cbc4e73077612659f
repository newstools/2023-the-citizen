GGML has implemented internships and other graduate programmes for several years in contributing towards skills development by providing opportunities to gain work experience. The internship programme complements the studies and provide the graduates with experience that could help them gain access to the labour market, GGML managing director Terry Strong said. “The internship programme is implemented for 12 months and this year, GGML has offered internship to 50 graduates, 30 females and 20 males. We would like to wish them all the very best as they report today to their different departments,” he said. The company’s senior manager for health, safety, environment and training, Dr Kiva Mvungi warned the graduates of conmen. “GGML does not receive money in exchange for a job or any other opportunity. Should you be asked for money in exchange for a job offer or suspect such activity, please report this immediately to our security department,” warned Dr Mvungi.
