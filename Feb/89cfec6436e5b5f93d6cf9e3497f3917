With the Proteas having made a significant breakthrough by reaching the T20 World Cup final at the weekend, national captain Sune Luus hopes the government and sports administrators will provide more support to raise the profile of women’s cricket. The SA team competed in a World Cup final for the first time, and while they lost to Australia in the trophy battle in front of a packed crowd at Newlands, Luus felt the players had done enough to show their potential after raising interest around the country with their performances on the field. Thank you Mzansi 🇿🇦Your support has been incredible 🫶#T20WorldCup #MyHero #AlwaysRising pic.twitter.com/gw0Wo9g60z— Proteas Women (@ProteasWomenCSA) February 26, 2023 “We’ve done our best to give girls in this country the best possible chance. Obviously we would have liked to have won (the final) but I don’t think we could have given it a better shot,” Luus said. “Now it’s up to Cricket South Africa and the minister of sport, and whoever’s in charge of cricket in this country, to knock on doors and open them, and give women’s cricket the best chance we can have to keep up with teams like Australia, England and India.” Despite losing by 19 runs to a powerhouse Australia side, who earned their third straight T20 world title, Luus was full of praise for her squad. And having experienced the pressure-filled cauldron at that level of the game, she believed they could perform even better at next year’s T20 World Cup in Bangladesh.
