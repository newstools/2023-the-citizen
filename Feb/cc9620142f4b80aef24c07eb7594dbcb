BEST BET RACE 2 EXACTA: 2-VIRGINIA BEACH AND 4-XPLICIT CONTENT Virginia Beach made an impressive winning debut over 800m when not really expected to winand looks well above average. This is a filly taking on the colts but she does get a 2.5kg sexallowance and that will help her cause. Xplicit Content has run two decent seconds and is the runner likely to chase home VirginiaBeach. VALUE BET RACE 3: NO 7 YOU’RE MY SUNSHINE – EACHWAY Alec Laird’s runner drifted in the betting on debut and did in his chances at the gate by losingground at the start. However, he still managed to produce the fastest 400m to finish. This Rafeef gelding is open to all kinds of improvement in his second start and is quite capable ofproducing an upset.
