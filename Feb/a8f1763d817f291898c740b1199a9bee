One of South Africa’s favourite desserts that has a long tradition, the milk tart, is receiving a well-deserved celebration on Monday (27 February), as it is Milk Tart Day.  Milk tart, or Melktert as it was originally known introduced by the Dutch settlers in the Western Cape in the 1600s and is said to have been adapted from a recipe for Mattentaart which is a small, sweet cake made from a filling of curdled milk.  This milk tart is extra special as it adds another local favourite peppermint crisp milk tart to the recipe.  ALSO READ: Recipe of the day: 4-ingredient milk tart squares To assemble:  This recipe is courtesy of Capsicum Culinary Studio Durban campus.
