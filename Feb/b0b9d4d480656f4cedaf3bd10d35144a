In the same way that we respected all 21 fixtures (before), we have to respect the remaining nine games.“We have to give them the same diligence and professionalism.

However, the lavish praise directed at Sundowns is not entirely embraced by coach Mokwena, who says he would rather have his team go about their business quietly.“We are very scared of praise. I try not to be influenced by what is said by the team and that allows us to keep on the ground. Praise is like being fed honey on a knife. We try to stay very far from praise,” says Mokwena.“We are the only team that has played eight games in January and I have nothing but incredible respect for this group of players. If I were to rate our performances out of 10, I would give it a 15 if allowed. I am very proud of this group.”
