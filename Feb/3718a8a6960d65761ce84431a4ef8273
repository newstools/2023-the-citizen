Billiat has been in and out of the side since arriving at Chiefs in 2018 due to injuries. He is currently out injured and according to sources will be out for the rest of this season. “The club are obviously worried that he is not helping the team because he spends more time in the medical centre than on the field,” said a source.

I do not see him returning next season. He further said that Chiefs want to handle Billiat’s exit as professionally as they can so it does not look like they are discarding him because of his injuries. “They could just let him go like they did with other players who had served the club well and won things. “But his situation makes it difficult. The coaches like him but the problem is the injuries,” added the source.
