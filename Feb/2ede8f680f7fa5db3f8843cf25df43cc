Dar es Salaam. The Tanzania Cooperative Development Commission (TCDC) has started implementing a strategy meant to empower cooperative societies with technology that will help them change their way of doing business. The new development was revealed yesterday by the commission’s chairman Abdulmajid Nsekela when he graced the opening of the cooperative stakeholders’ meeting. The meeting was geared to discuss the progress of the cooperative societies and set strategies for strengthening the sector. “Investment in modern digital systems will increase efficiency of cooperative societies and the authorities mandated to oversee the sector,” noted Mr Nsekela. He said, among other things, recommendations aired during the meeting will help in making the cooperative societies’ system even more modern. This, he added, will enable citizens to take part in their cooperative societies effectively for their and nation’s prosperity. The Cooperative Societies registrar, Dr Benson Ndiege, said, “The stakeholder’s meeting was targeting to chart a way forward on how to shape the sector.”
