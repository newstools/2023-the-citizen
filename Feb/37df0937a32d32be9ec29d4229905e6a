It also seeks to expand public understanding of the role of the SANDF in the life of the nation and to demonstrate through live simulations of military action the capability of the army, navy, air force and South African Medical Health Service. Armed Forces Day also showcases the different career paths that are available for young people in the SANDF to pursue. Ramaphosa is expected to commence the day with a wreath-laying ceremony at the Empangeni World War II Monument.  The president will then proceed to the military parade where he will take a salute from the SANDF and deliver an address to the forces and the public.
