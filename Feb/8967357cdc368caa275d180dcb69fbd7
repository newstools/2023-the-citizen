The Buccaneers assistant coach added that the season has reached a difficult stage where teams are looking to achieve their end of season objectives. Maritzburg will be heading into this clash with the team aiming for three points in a quest to save their DStv Premiership status. The Team of Choice is currently occupying 15th place on the log having only managed to collect 21 points in 19 games. The Sea Robbers are in fourth place on the log with 28 points having played 19 matches. “We know that they are in a need (for three points), but this is football and at the end of the season there are teams that are fighting to get out of relegation, other teams are fighting for a title, for Caf positions and to survive in the league,” said Almenara.ALSO READ: Lessons from Chiefs loss equip Maritzburg for Pirates war “I think it is going to be like that in the next three months.
