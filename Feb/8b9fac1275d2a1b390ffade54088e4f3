The trailer for the 10th instalment of the Fast & Furious franchise dropped three days ago and the streets of social media are up in arms about one of the unrealistic stunts in Fast X, also known as Fast & Furious 10. Scheduled to be released in the United States on 19 May, 2023, Dominic Toretto and most of the gang are back doing what they do best – unrealistic driving manoeuvres – and Dom once again protecting his family and gang from a bad guy who is out for revenge.

What they didn’t know was that Reyes’ son, Dante (Aquaman’s Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price, and the ultimate target is Dominique’s 8-year-old son. The 3 minute 42 second trailer has already garnered more than 31 million views since it’s release on 10 February, 2023. While die-hard fans of the franchise only have good things to say about the movie, people over on Twitter are a little sceptic about some of the unrealistic stunts they saw in the trailer.
