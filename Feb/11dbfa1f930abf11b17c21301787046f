His exit from Swallows was confirmed by the club boss David Mogashoa to SABC Sport. “We agreed with the player that it was not working out, so we thought it was in his best interest to allow him to leave early,” Mogashoa explained. “The coach (Ernst Middendorp) had made it clear that he did not see him in his plans even though he is a talented player. I have spoken to Given and he is obviously disappointed, but this will give him an opportunity to start afresh. “It’s unfortunate, the talent is obviously there. But there are so many players in his position and there’s just no room. I also alerted Chiefs, as he is their academy product, to ask if they would have a place for him and they also have a lot of players in his position,” Mogashoa added.ALSO READ: Veteran Makola set for Soweto return Thibedi is a product of the Chiefs development academy and he played under Zwane before he was promoted and then sent out on loan at Swallows in the 2019/20 season.
