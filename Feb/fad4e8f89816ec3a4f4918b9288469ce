Dar es Salaam.  Tanzania’s representatives in the African Champions League, Simba Club failed to beat Raja Casablanca in the second game of the group stage after they lost 3-0 to the Moroccan side on Saturday night. The defeat broke Simba's 20-year unbeaten home record in international competitions which has seen many giants fall at both the former national stadium and at the Benjamin Mkapa. Raja Casablanca’s goals were scored by Hamza Khabba in the 30th minute with a hard hit shot that beat goalkeeper Aishi Manula while Soufiane Benjdida scored Raja's second goal in the 83rd minute before Ismail Mokadem scored the third from the spot in the 85th minute. The two late goals came against the round of play after the hosts dominated the proceedings in the second half but with very little to show. Playing an almost full house, Simba were on several occasions caught on the break by the Moroccans who piled the mid-field and defense lines.  This was the first time that Simba met Raja Casablanca but it is the fourth for them to meet a team from Morocco. This is the first game that Simba has lost in the group stage since 2003 on home soil in the African Champions League in 10 matches, winning eight and drawing one. This is the second defeat in a row for Simba in this group stage after the Msimbazi giants lost their first game 1-0 against Horoya who were on Saturday was also forced to a 0-0 draw by Vipers from Uganda. Simba are now routed at the bottom of the four-team table with Raja Casablanca maintaining a clean record having not conceded a goal, scoring eight in the process.
