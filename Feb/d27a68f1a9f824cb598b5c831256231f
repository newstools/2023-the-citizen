Fans of the late Kiernan ‘AKA’ Forbes received some answers about the legend of Sim Dope, a song he released in honour of his friend. It was a story many didnt believe, as people didnt think Sim Dope was a real person.   AKA’s memorial occurred on Friday and was a celebration of his life, music, family and his connection to God.  Many friends and family members filled up Sandton Convention Centre to remember the rapper who was shot and killed in Durban last week with his friend Tebello ‘Tibz’ Motsoane. Simphiwe Gumede known as Sim Dope’s tribute had guests on their feet.  The childhood friends had known each other since the age of 11. Sim said AKA made him comfortable to be himself. They both attended St John’s College in 2000 and participated in similar sports.  AKA made a song honouring his Sim Dope over four years ago and during his memorial, Sim paid tribute to his childhood friend.  Retelling the story of his name, Sim said AKA thought this was big achievement he made it into the rugby team and gave a suggestion for his nickname.  “Now that you are a ‘boet’ you can’t be going on a Saturday and be known as Simphiwe, I mean that’s not dangerous,” AKA told him.  READ NOW: AKA Memorial: ‘I gained two daughters’– Lynn Forbes on Nadia Nakai and DJ Zinhle Sim said AKA was a “lover boy” and loved writing love letters.

Sim had some notoriety after his dad brought US hip-hop star Rick Ross for his birthday.  Robert Gumede is reportedly a very wealthy man and is the founder of the IT firm Gijima Technologies. The company has over 12 000 employees and he serves on multiple boards, advisory and councils such as the South African Chamber of Commerce to the USA Chair.  AKA released the song four years ago. In the music video, he is seen driving a Ferrari and in the opening few lyrics he raps: “Hands in the air if you been broke. I see millionaires making bread, that’s the end goal. Private jet Benzo, can’t see through the window.  “So if I die I pray to God he bring me back as Sim Dope. Sim Dope, 911 rim spokes. “So if I die I pray to God he bring me back as Sim Dope,” was the hook for the song.  AKA’s private funeral will take place over the weekend.
