NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is Saturday expected to tell a major security forum in Germany that allies must provide Ukraine what it needs to defeat Russia, as Kyiv pleads for more weapons.  "We must give Ukraine what they need to win and prevail as a sovereign, independent nation in Europe," he will tell the Munich Security Conference, according to excerpts of his speech seen by AFP. His comments to world leaders will come ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia sending its troops into Ukraine, bringing war to Europe for the first time in decades and upending the global security landscape.  Allies, led by the United States, have sent billions of dollars of armaments to Kyiv, from artillery to air defence systems, but Ukraine says it needs more to launch a successful counter-offensive.
