It’s a sad day for mayonnaise lovers, particularly those who consistently bought Unilever’s Hellmann’s mayonnaise. The American mayo brand became a favourite pairing for our sandwich’s, tuna salads and potato salads, however this pairing will no longer be available in South Africa. With rumours running wild that the mayonnaise will be discontinued, Hellmann’s South Africa confirmed on Twitter that this is in fact a sad reality. They wrote: “It’s hard to say goodbye to delicious Hellmann’s mayonnaise But, due to high inflationary import costs, we will regretfully be discontinuing Hellmann’s in South Africa until further notice. A big thanks to our loyal fans for all the mayo love over the years.” It’s hard to say goodbye to delicious Hellmann’s mayonnaise 🥪 🥗 But, due to high inflationary import costs, we will regretfully be discontinuing Hellmann’s in South Africa until further notice. A big thanks to our loyal fans for all the mayo love over the years 💙 pic.twitter.com/ptoph5KSXL— Hellmanns Mayonnaise (@HellmannsZA) January 31, 2023 Hellmann’s was first made in New York by Richard Hellman in 1913 at a deli shop creating delicious jars of mayonnaise. The brand is known for their creamy texture and taste, a bit thicker than their competitors. For their customers it’s the best mayonnaise on the shelves. Because of its long history, passed on for generations and their customers loving its taste, South Africans were not happy at the thought of buying the alternatives. Twitter user Kelly N wrote: “Omg does this mean we have to eat that lame tangy mayo. #Hellmanns Mayonnaise was the only good thing we had.” Brynn Goldbatt added that for a company like Hellmann’s to discontinue due to the rising cost of inflation is alarming; “Mayonnaise is quintessential [and] a staple to all fridges and Hellmann’s reputation and name it’s far bigger than what we comprehend. Hellmann’s is a notorious brand, I mean they specialise in mayonnaise. They are the pioneers and kings of the mayonnaise industry within our economy… “and I mean this isn’t just a chocolate log or a peanut butter flavour. This is far bigger [than] that. This is big news for the condemned business. It’s staggering.” ALSO READ: Nine food trends for 2023 – Convenience is king On their Facebook page, the announcement resulted in over 17,000 comments and 50,000 shares. omg does this mean we have to eat that lame tangy mayo. #Hellmanns Mayonnaise was the only good thing we had. 😭😭— Kerry N (@MissKerry04) January 31, 2023 I just read that @Hellmanns mayonnaise will be discontinued in South Africa🥺🥺 #Xoli #poscastandchillwithmacg #Sandton #Ewallet pic.twitter.com/fJKk3GvxR4— Mr Gun (@MrGun_Official) January 31, 2023 @Hellmanns is it true?!
