Financial markets are platforms where financial instruments are traded, these markets can be categorized into different types stock markets, bond markets, foreign exchange markets, and much more. These markets provide a way for investors and traders to buy and sell these assets in order to make a profit. Traders in financial markets are individuals or institutions who buy and sell financial assets with the aim of making a profit. Zenfinex Africa Zenfinex Africa’s founder had a dream of becoming a successful trader at a time when trading and the Financial Markets as we know them today was limited to only a few privileged, privately educated elites and large corporate financial institutions.  After proper education and over many years of ups and down, he realized that the only way to succeed within the sector is by first, getting impartial education from the right source to determine firstly whether it is what anyone aspires to partake in. Second, by applying skills acquired from education to practical experience. There are no shortcuts to this. Over the recent past, we realized online trading, particularly forex trading was spreading like wildfire all over because many people erroneously believed it was easy to access to wealth as marketed by many brokers. This led to an era of massive growth and profits for brokers and corporate institutions whilst many ordinary people were left devastated due to a lack of proper knowledge and skills.  Thankfully, laws and regulations are now in place to stop predatory practices. Zenfinex Africa, then went on a massive “financial awareness program” campaign, sensitizing people all over and particularly in many developing African countries. We enlightened professionals and ordinary individuals on trading the financial markets, the predatory aspects of the sector, as well as the safe and legal process to partake in it if one chooses trading as a career. Over the years, we then realized that most individuals, out of desperation to be successful or wealthy fall into the trap of thinking they can be successful really quickly by trading. It is a fact that the majority of retail traders globally fail. We, therefore, aimed to sensitize and lead by servicing responsibly. We service the region by, spreading impartial education about the sector and profession so that individuals who are not meant to be in the sector discover that at a very early stage, provide thorough education and life’s skills training for the individuals who intend to partake in trading the financial markets, particularly forex, provide the technology and support for retail, professional and institutional traders across Africa to access Global markets.
