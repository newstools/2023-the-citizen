One of the country’s most prominent sexual and reproductive health programs, DKT Tanzania, brought together players in the SRH sector in an exclusive stakeholder event held at the organization’s head office in Masaki, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The event which had the agenda of exchanging ideas on the role of SRH programs in meeting the demand of much needed sexual and reproductive health services in Tanzania was also attended by Engender Health, UMATI and Medicins Du Monde (Doctors of the world) and many other stake holders including reigning Miss Tanzania. Speaking at the event, DKT Tanzania marketing manager Deogratius Kithama said, “Our organization is committed to providing adequate family planning tools such as Kiss condoms to the Tanzanian people at subsidized prices that will ensure more people can afford them.” Condoms can be used for protection against both unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. On her side, Halima Kopwe, the reigning Miss Tanzania 2022, spoke on the need for education among youth that will allow them to make more informed decisions about their reproductive health. The current government has taken a stance in support of families, as echoed by Her Excellency President Samia Suluhu Hassan’s statements on the need for “speed reduction in childbirth.” Meanwhile, SRH stakeholders are advocating for policy reforms in areas such as the marketing of reproductive products.
