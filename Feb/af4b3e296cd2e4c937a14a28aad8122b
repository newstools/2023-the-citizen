As Mzansi Magic lost a few telenovelas over the last few years such as The Queen and Isibaya, the channel is turning the limited series Umkhokha – The Curse into a telenovela.  The series is about two families at war that will invoke emotive feelings filled with twists and turns.  The show is the production by Rhythm World Production and head written by Siphosethu Tshapu and Kagiso Mogale, with Mandla KaNozulu as the originator of the concept.  In a statement, M-Net confirmed that Umkhokha will continue from the cliffhanger from season one after reports suggested this would be the case last week.

Duma Ndlovu, the executive producer of Umkhokha – The Curse said it’s amazing to see the show transition from a 13-episode format to a daily telenovela. “The drama has intensified, and the drama has heightened. There are so many twists in this long form. We believe and know that the viewers will relate and love it even more.” Shirley Adonisi, director of local entertainment channels at M-Net said they listened to audiences’ needs to have the short format series be longer. “It’s always a positive conundrum when viewers express that a show was on air for too short a time, and that was the overwhelming reaction we were met with when Umkhokha came to an end after 13 weeks. Audiences were glued to the show and constantly engaged with the story and spoke about it on social media and on the radio – so its return is long-awaited. We’re pleased that it will now be a telenovela,” she said.  Compiled by Sandisiwe Mbhele.
