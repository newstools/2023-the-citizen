Mamelodi Sundowns are always the favourites in any DStv Premiership match, but an in-form Orlando Pirates probably have more chance than most of breaking Masandawana’s winning streak this weekend. ALSO READ: Pirates beat Gallants to make it three wins in a row The Buccaneers host the runaway leaders this Saturday in Orlando, and Jose Riveiro’s men are on a high of three wins on the spin, with the nine goals in that time also pointing at a solution to their goalscoring woes. Downs midfielder Neo Maema is expecting the Sea Robbers to come out for revenge as Downs beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture a little over a month ago. “As a team, we are expecting a highly motivated side … we know that no one needs motivation when it comes to such games,” said Maema. “Pirates have the confidence and are in the mood for this game given their recent results. We anticipate that they will come to us with the same approach as when we played them the first time in the league. “However, they are slightly different because they used to play four at the back but now they play with three defenders. Their game model has not changed much, they will still be difficult on the counter attack and their supporters are going to be behind them because they are playing at home. “It won’t be a surprise to (also) see them coming at us but we have our own processes and we know how to guard against such.” While the Brazilians will already reach 55 points if they get the better of Pirates, Maema has revealed that the instruction from Rulani Mokwena is that they should not lift the foot off the pedal. If they do win all of their 10 remaining games, Sundowns can set a new record of 82 points. “When it comes to the title race, it is more about bettering the points that we had in the previous season. It is not necessarily about looking at what other teams are doing. We are taking it one game at a time,” said Maema.
