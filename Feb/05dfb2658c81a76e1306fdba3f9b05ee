Rapper Nadia Nakai and her late boyfriend, Kiernan ‘AKA’ Forbes, were never shy to express their love and an old video has surfaced of their deep connection.  AKA and his long-time friend Tebello ‘Tibz’ Motsoane were gunned down outside the popular Wish Restaurant on Durban’s Florida road last Friday, news that shocked the entertainment industry and the country to its core.  AKA and Nadia had been together for over a year.  Since the tragic deaths, fans have shared Nadia and Aka’s strong bond, with a video of how they met and fell in love resurfacing on social media on Valentine’s Day.  The two are seen cooking together for an episode of The Insider SA where Aka and Nadia are cooking mac and cheese.  The clip is centred around their love for cooking.   They share their memories of when they started cooking, as AKA says he started cooking because the kitchen is where he could be “artistic and be creative”, including his love for cooking shows.  Nadia shared that her mom’s background, who is Zimbabwean, influenced her cooking and making traditional meals.
