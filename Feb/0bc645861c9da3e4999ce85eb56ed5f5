Dar es Salaam. American Peace Corps Volunteers returned to Tanzania at the weekend, following an absence of nearly three years. The 18 volunteers are the first to come to Tanzania since the outbreak of the Covid-19 in March 2020, the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam said in a statement. The pandemic forced the repatriation of more than 7000 volunteers worldwide, including 158 from Tanzania. Prior to the repatriation, Peace Corps Volunteers had been serving in Tanzania for over six decades. From September 1961 to March 2020, over 3200 Peace Corps Volunteers served in Tanzania, working in education, agriculture, and health sectors to address critical development priorities while promoting world peace and friendship. “Given such deep ties, the return of volunteers to Tanzania following a three-year absence is a cause for celebration,” said Peace Corps Tanzania Country Director Stephanie Joseph de Goes. “I am grateful to the government of Tanzania, and our community partners, for welcoming the Peace Corps, it is an honor to work with such committed people in this beautiful nation. Since March 2020, Peace Corps staff around the world have worked to strengthen the foundation of the agency," she said. She added: “We are now ready to relaunch volunteer service and to meet this historic moment with our community partners and our Peace Corps Tanzania staff.
