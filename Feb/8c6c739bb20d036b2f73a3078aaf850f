Management at Amakhosi believes that Zwane knows what he is doing with the club and to see the club recording some poor results doesn’t really faze them too much. “You should know that coach Arthur is trusted at the club, I think everybody knows that by now. The management believes in him and they have seen what he has done with the young players. The club has a plan, … they know that this season is going to be difficult. There are a lot of new players and the coaches need to find the right balance,” said a source.

A lot of people are talking out there and they think Arthur will lose his job. “But that won’t happen, at least for now because there is progress and a good plan for the team. Remember what happened with coach Steve (Komphela)? They believed in him, the fans were very angry and no one thought he would spend as much time as he did. What I just want to say to you is that coach Arthur is very safe and his job is also safe.”
