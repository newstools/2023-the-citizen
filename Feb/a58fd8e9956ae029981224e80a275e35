The legislation is expected to come into operation on 3 March 2023. “The DNA Act is a crucial weapon in the police’s arsenal of crime-fighting tools against GBVF, specifically with regard to the identification of offenders. This piece of legislation will remove serial rapists off our streets,” said Cele. From October to December 2022, Cele said 4 992 suspects were arrested for GBVF-related crimes. During the same period of reporting, 71 accused were handed down 89 life sentences. “219 accused were sentenced between one to nine years imprisonment, culminating to a total of 1 079 years behind bars. 143 accused were sentenced between 10 to 19 years imprisonment, which is a combined sentence of 2 063 years’ imprisonment. “While 67 other accused were collectively sentenced to 20 years and more for GBVF-related crimes,” he said.
