However, James was referring to an American man named Mark Pilgrim, not South Africa’s beloved radio and television host.  ….I log in to twitter and saw Mark Pilgrim trending. My heart jumped with anxiety. I'm glad he's alive. May God defeat this cancer upon his life 🤲— Maverick Huzaifah (@DJMaverickZA) February 10, 2023 In recent weeks, more and more social media users have shared their concern for Mark and how they check his profile regularly for updates hoping that they will see him state that he is on the road to recovery.  In February 2022, just weeks after celebrating being in remission for over three decades, the radio host confirmed that his cancer had returned. He was first diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer in 1988. According to his Wikipedia page, it was an aggressive form of cancer and spread to his lungs and kidneys.  Seeing Mark Pilgrim on the trending list is giving me the worst anxiety… I keep checking 😭— Mrs Mahlangu (@yayamahlangu) February 10, 2023 A month after sharing his diagnosis with the public, he began his chemo journey. Towards the end of 2022, he began suffering from fluid buildup in his lungs which led to a prolonged hospital stay and the procedures mentioned above.  I wake up every morning just waiting to see an update from Mark Pilgrim 😞— Lee-Roy Wright (@LeeRoyWright) February 2, 2023 He was released from the hospital just in time to spend the new year at home only to be readmitted for yet another procedure. He has since spent time alternating between his home and the hospital depending on what treatment he needs and what kind of environment it needs to be administered in.  A lot of sleeping the last few days. Body is depleted. After chemo and immuno last Thursday  it’s just been pouring out both ends. I’m like a shriveled pea. 😳🥴. pic.twitter.com/Lb6fsxXFpG— Mark Pilgrim (@MarkPilgrimZA) February 2, 2023 READ NEXT: ‘You got this Mark’: Black Coffee, DJ Fresh and more rally behind Mark Pilgrim
