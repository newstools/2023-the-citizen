With the warm weather this weekend, this delicious home-made peach cobbler ice cream recipe will be a hit. While it’s much easier and quicker to buy a two-litre ice cream from Pick n Pay, it won’t be as filled with all the extra delicious pieces you can add when making your own ice cream. While this recipe will take some time to prepare, it will be so worth it when the compliments start rolling in.
