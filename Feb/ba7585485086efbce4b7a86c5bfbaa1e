Dar es Salaam. The Tanzania Communications Authority (TCRA) has filtered more than 52,000 lines that were being used for fraudulent activities even as it admits that it continues to face three challenges including the wave of citizens who are arrested for involvement in corruption without their participation. The figures come at a time when the communications regulator was to switch off Sim cards that had not been verified under the biometric registration system. “For example, you find that the Sim card that has been registered in the name of a grandmother in a village is being used to conduct fraudulent activities in the city….That is why we emphasise that it is wrong to aid someone to register a Sim card in your name,” said a senior chief communications officer at TCRA, Mr Semu Mwakyanjala. Thobith Lubida, a transaction services agent, said yesterday the ongoing exercise would increase the security of their operations. However, he stated that TCRA must also supervise fraudulent agents who steal client information during line registration. “If you go to an agent to register a line, he tells you to put a fingerprint, if he tells you to put it again, you should know that he has taken the information of the first finger, he can collect information of 10 people and sell it without any information to the owner. That is also one of the ways some fraudulent activities were being undertaken,” he said. Various family heads have used their IDs to register Sim cards for their housemaids, friends, students and other relatives.
