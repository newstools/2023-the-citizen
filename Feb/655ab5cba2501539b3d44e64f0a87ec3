In the family’s corner alongside his parents – Tony and Lynn Forbes, were his brother – Steffan, his friend – Mahlatse ‘Zazboy’ Sethole and his girlfriend – Nadia Nakai who had not yet made a public appearance since the news broke.   AKA was shot and killed in Durban on Florida Road. His close friend and former manager Tebello ‘Tibz’ Motsoane also died at the scene after being hit by one of the bullets.  The Forbes family was all dressed in black, with Nadia wearing a doek as most African women traditionally do in the event of a death in their family. Details of AKA’s upcoming memorial were given prior to the briefing. His memorial will be open to the public and will take place on Friday, 17 February 2023, at Sandton Convention Centre.  Limited tickets will be available and the memorial will celebrate his life and music. There will also be a live stream of proceedings on AKA’s YouTube page for those who may not be able to make it.  RELATED: AKA’s memorial will be open to the public but not his provincial funeral AKA will receive a private provincial funeral that will take place on Saturday, 18 February 2023.  It was made clear, early on, that the briefing was organised to acknowledge the outpouring of love from the public.  AKA’s father Tony said, “Kiernan was loved by his family, his fans, and the ‘Megacy’. His colleagues extended themselves with [their] outpourings”.  Speaking about recent chatter surrounding those responsible for his son’s murder, Tony Forbes said the family would not entertain the claims made on social media alleging that a number of the late rapper’s friends may have been involved in the shooting.  This comes after fellow rappers DA L.E.S and Yanga slammed the rumours in defence of Don Design (Tshediso Mokoko) and the other people incorrectly fingered in the crime by overzealous social media users.  Please leave @dondesign alone. He had nothing to do with this. He’s always had Kiernan’s back and side from beginning till end. He’d never do anything to hurt him. He’s been through enough! LEAVE HIM ALONE HE NEEDS TO HEAL! We all do 🤬😭💔— Da L.E.S (@2freshLES) February 13, 2023 Tony denied the claims, saying: “We are aware of the various statements made in the media. Most importantly, we have been aware of the NPA declartions since June last year. However, our focus right now is to celebrate and give Kiernan a dignified send-off with little distraction as possible”. NPA said on Monday that they declined to prosecute anyone in relation to the death of Anele Tembe, his former fiance.

We are deeply saddened by his untimely.” “We do not condone what has been said about his friends and those making various statements and we appeal for them from doing so.”  Tony thanked the Durban police and other provincial officials who assisted them on the fatal night.  The conference concluded with Tony saying the family wants to celebrate his life and contribution to the youth.  Tibz’ funeral will take place at a private ceremony over the weekend.
