Dar es Salaam. The Tanzania Meteorological Authority has allayed fears of the possibility of Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which was rumoured earlier that would fall land in the country. TMA in a statement issued on Monday, February 20, 2023, said it was closely monitoring the cyclone that is currently threatening the Indian Ocean islands of Madagascar and Mauritius. The authority said once it finds any need to issue a report on the cyclone, it will do so. "Any report on bad weather is issued to the public only when it meets standards and operational guidelines," the statement explains. For the past few days across various social media, reports there have been reports circulating that Cyclone Freddy will hit the country. However,Â according to the Tanzania Meteorological Authority Act No. 2 of 2019, it is only the authority with legal rights to issue information regarding weather conditions, and it is against the law for someone else to do so. In their statement, TMA, explained that for about a week the authorities have been monitoring the trend of Cyclone Freddy which is currently threatening the southwest of the Indian Ocean near the coast of Madagascar and they are satisfied that it will bear no direct effects on Tanzania's territory. "The Tanzania Meteorological Authority continues to closely monitor the trend of this cyclone and will issue information as soon as there is a need to do so," it explained. TMA urged the public to keep following the information and warnings of weather provided by TMA and to also seek the advice of experts in the weather management sector in order to reduce the effects of bad weather conditions.
