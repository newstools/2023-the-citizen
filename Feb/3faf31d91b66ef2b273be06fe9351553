Simba and Yanga, Tanzania’s representatives in the African continental club championships, will play their second matches this weekend. At 7 pm today at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium Simba, who represent Tanzania in the African Champions League, will play host to Raja Casablanca of Morocco in group C. Tomorrow, Yanga, who are representing Tanzania in the CAF Confederation Cup, will play TP Mazembe from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, also at 7pm at the Benjamin Mkapa Stadium. In their opening group stage matches, Simba lost 1-0 away to Horoya AC of Guinea and Yanga lost 2-0 to US Monastir of Tunisia. The two teams must win this weekend’s matches in order to maintain their chances of moving on to the knockout rounds of the two competitions. Simba and Yanga are currently without single point in their respective groups, and if they don’t perform well, they risk not making it to the knockout rounds. Simba and Yanga players must never lose sight of the fact that they are competing against more experienced rivals. It is a well-known fact that TP Mazembe and Raja Casablanca have the best records in the African clubs competitions. The two teams must understand that the Tanzanian football fans are behind them and that they shouldn’t rest on their laurels because the competition’s toughest phase has just begun – and the going is going to be tough indeed. We fervently implore the players of both sides to fight extremely hard during the matches if they are to slow down their opponents. In order to produce results that will make Tanzanians proud, Simba and Yanga players must play with determination. So: GO Simba, Go Yanga, GO, we say – and ramp up Tanzanian football in international rankings.
