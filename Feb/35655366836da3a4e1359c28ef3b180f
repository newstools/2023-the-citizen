Mercedes-Benzâ€™s silent approach of revealing pricing details online has expanded to include the all-new GLC that debuted globally in June last year. Newly designed with the MRA platform from the W206 C-Class serving as its base, the second generation GLC, known internally as the X254, sports a design similar to the all-electric EQE when viewed from the front, with the rear being a clear evolution from the preceding X253. Based on the pricing details first obtained by cars.co.za the GLC line-up, initially, spans three engines; one petrol and two diesel, with all three being offered in Avantgarde or AMG Line trim level specification.

As for the powertrains, the GLC 220d once again serves as the base model with outputs of 145kW/440Nm from the new 2.0-litre OM 654 mill. Replacing the previous GLC 250d, the 300d tops the diesel and entire GLC range with a considerable 198kW/550Nm from the same four-cylinder unit. In terms of performance, the GLC 220d will get from 0-100 km/h in eight seconds and reach a top speed of 219 km/h, while the benchmark sprint in the GLC 300d is dispatched with in 6.3 seconds. The still to be confirmed top speed is expected to be around the 240 km/h mark. The sole petrol derivative, the GLC 300, serves-up 150kW/320Nm from its 2.0-litre turbo unit, enough for a top speed of 240 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 6.2 seconds. As with its diesel siblings, the petrol is outfitted solely with 9G Tronic gearbox, the 4Matic all-wheel-drive system and the 48-volt EQ mild-hybrid system that adds 17kW/200Nm for short spells. At present, no plans are seemingly in place to bring the plug-in hybrid GLC 300e, GLC 400e or GLC 300de to South Africa. More likely though are AMG models as well as the GLC Coupe that are all still to be revealed. Information from cars.co.za. This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.
