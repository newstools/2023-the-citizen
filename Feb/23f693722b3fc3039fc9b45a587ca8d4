RACE 4 NO 5 MARY LAMB – WIN Justin Snaith’s charge looked a very unlucky loser when suffering interference in the straight. She flew up late, producing the fastest final 400m to finish, to lose by just 1.05 lengths. This Dynasty filly is expected to get it right today. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 11 PORQUE TE VAS – EACHWAY Mike Stewart is one of those shrewd trainers who finds the right race for his runners. On the surface, Porque Te Vas looks a no-hoper but her merit rating has come down and she comes into this race very well handicapped on collateral form. Stewart has also engaged Keagan de Melo for this ride.
