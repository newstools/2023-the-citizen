The government, through the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA), has said that it has increased funding in order to further tighten restrictions on the access of content that is considered immoral and against Tanzanian ideals, such as pornography. The government strategy was revealed by the Minister for Information, Communication, and Information Technology, Nape Nnauye, while answering a question in Parliament tabled by a legislator who wanted to know the steps being taken by the government to block access to rampant pornography. The minister said that the new system that the government will install will restrict, to a great extent, access to pornography and other related explicit content. He also noted that the government has the ability to identify whoever is sharing such explicit content online. He thus urged anyone who was the recipient of such content to delete it immediately. The latest TCRA report on data consumption shows that Tanzanian internet users consumed over 200 trillion gigabytes between October and December 2022. However, it didn't say how much of the data was used for streaming and downloading pornographic content.
