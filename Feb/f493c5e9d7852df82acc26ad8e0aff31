Stormers head coach John Dobson said he was delighted to be able to keep continuity in selection, with just two changes made to their forward pack for the United Rugby Championship encounter with the Bulls in Pretoria on Saturday. Hooker Scarra Ntubeni and flank Willie Engelbrecht come into the starting line-up for the north-south clash, which kicks off at 5.05pm at Loftus Versfeld. The starting backline that did duty for the Stormers in the 46-19 win against the Sharks in Durban a fortnight ago is unchanged, while utility forward Ernst van Rhyn makes his return from injury on the replacements bench.
