With the rainy, cloudy and cooler weather in stores for most provinces in South Africa for the rest of the weekend, nothing is better than devouring a sweet dessert that will please the taste buds such as tucking into a rich lemon meringue pie.  Lemon meringue pie is often a top choice during brunch or a cheat day. From the buttery crust, to the tart lemon custard and finishing off with the fluffy meringue, there is nothing better with a cup of coffee or tea.  This recipe incorporates an already-made sweet shortcrust pastry.
