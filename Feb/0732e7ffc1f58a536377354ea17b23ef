President Joe Biden indicated on Friday that he will indeed be announcing a 2024 bid for a second term – only not right away. Speculation has been mounting over Biden’s plans.

Earlier this month, an extensive medical test found him to be “healthy, vigorous” and “fit to successfully execute the duties of the president”.
