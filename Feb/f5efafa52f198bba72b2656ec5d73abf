Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta dedicated his side’s 1-0 win at Leicester to remain on top of the Premier League to the people of Ukraine, one year on from Russia’s invasion.

Arteta’s men even briefly surrendered top spot to Manchester City, but are now two points clear of their title rivals with a game in hand. “It was really important because it creates more belief in the players, around the club and externally,” added Arteta on his side’s return to winning ways. “But I had the belief the players could do it. It was coming back to some details and basics that get games away from us that we made much more. The last two games — especially today — we have done it much more.”
