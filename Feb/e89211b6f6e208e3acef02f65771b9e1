Dar es Salaam. Zanzibar’s tourism sector has recorded a major rebound beyond figures recorded in the pre-pandemic days, a new reports shows. According to the Tourism Statistical Release No 73, Zanzibar recorded 548,503 arrivals in 2022, compared to 538,264 that was recorded in 2019. With an average of 1502 visitors entering the Island on a daily basis, December recorded the highest number of visitors with 66,720, other months that recorded high arrivals include July (58,157), August (61,388), October (57,547), and November (55,150). Speaking to The Citizen, Zanzibar’s minister for Tourism and Heritage, Simai Mohammed Said, said that the deliberate decision by the United Republic of Tanzania not to lockdown the country played big role in the early rebound of the sector. “We remained open as other parts of the world went into forced lockdowns, all we needed was to fulfil the airline requirements of having a PCR and at arrival we only tested for temperature,” he said. This, in his view, though it attracted negative publicity in foreign media, it became a blessing in disguise because everyone wanted to know about Tanzania and Zanzibar in particular. He added that the rising numbers is due to the improvement of data collections at the point of entry which is the airport and seaport. “These numbers could actually be higher than that because visitors coming from Tanzania-Mainland considered as locals, yet some end up in five-star hotels where they even stay more than European visitors,” said the tourism minister. He said that if these are factored in the sector could be well above the targeted 850,000 annual arrivals given the fact Zanzibar remains the most favoured destination for people on the Mainland-Tanzania and East Africans who spend holidays such as Easter and Christmas on the isles.
