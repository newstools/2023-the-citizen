There is every reason to believe that the government intends to let Starlink, the world-famous internet service provider, operate in the country. The public back and forth between Starlink owner Elon Musk and authorities over permits risks tarnishing the country’s image as an investment destination of choice. Tanzania has an active policy of attracting and facilitating investments to the extent of offering incentives. In fact the policy gives strategic investments special attention. Starlink is a strategic investment. We are not vouching any incentives for Starlink but it is our view that the government should meet Elon Musk halfway in his intention to start providing internet services in the country. As a country we have everything to gain. Starlink internet service provision capabilities will give Tanzania’s digital economy the much needed boost. Data providers currently operating in the country have done a tremendous job, their investments are worthwhile and are still very much needed. But the country cannot pass over this opportunity to have reliable internet services for any reason whatsoever. The competition from Starlink must be taken by local internet providers as an opportunity to innovate, to improve services and expand coverage in areas where the American firm might not reach. As per its commercial strategies Starlink has a tendency to focus on major cities and towns. Starlink’s high up-front equipment fees and the fact that its internet offers more data, faster speeds and fewer data limitations makes it more ideal to businesses operating multiple devices. The fact that it charges no cancellation fees means that customers can switch to other providers whenever it suits their demands.
