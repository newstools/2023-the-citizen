While there are women who love being spoilt with roses and chocolates on Valentine’s Day, this yearly treat can cost you dearly if you don’t go into your relationship with open eyes and a clear mind. We’ve seen how Netflix’s Tinder Swindler conned several women out of their hard-earned cash and the last thing you want on Valentine’s Day is to find out that you have been the victim of a heartless romance scammer. Online dating has never been more popular, which makes it a risky adventure for those seeking love. But there are ways to spot a scammer and red flags to look out for. Data from the Federal Trade Commission in the United States showed that in 2021 reported losses to romance scammers were up nearly 80% compared to the previous year.  This was followed by an alert issued by the FBI which noted victims of romance fraud lost $1 billion in 2021 alone.  While current reliable figures are difficult to establish, romance scams, both in South Africa and across the globe, are likely to be underreported because of the personal nature of the crime and victims’ feelings of embarrassment. According to the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (SABRIC) some terror groups have been targeting South Africans to finance their criminal acts through romance scams.  It also reports that online dating scams are used by fraudsters to launder the illicit proceeds of crime.  In 2021, eight suspects were arrested in Cape Town in connection with an online dating scam and stealing more than R100 million from victims in various countries.
