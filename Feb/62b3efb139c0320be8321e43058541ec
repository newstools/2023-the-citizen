Heinrich Klaasen continued to flaunt his spectacular form on Sunday, laying the foundation with a superb century as Durban’s Super Giants earned a crushing 151-run victory over the Pretoria Capitals in their SA20 clash in Centurion. After losing the toss and being sent in to bat, the Super Giants got off to a spectacular start, with captain Quinton de Kock and Ben McDermott sharing 76 runs for the first wicket. Just as they looked to be running away with it, however, De Kock was caught and bowled by James Neetham after smashing a quickfire 43 runs off just 20 balls.
