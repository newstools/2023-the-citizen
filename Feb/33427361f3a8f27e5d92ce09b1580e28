Even when they are ‘outplayed’, Mamelodi Sundowns win. Orlando Pirates head coach Jose Riveiro was at pains to say how well his side had played on Saturday, after they lost 1-0 to Mamelodi Sundowns at Orlando Stadium.

We look at Chiefs and whether there really is a plan under the guidance of Arthur Zwane. You can listen to the latest Ballz to the Wall Podcast right here:
