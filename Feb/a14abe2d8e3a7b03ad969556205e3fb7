Turffontein 26 February BEST BET RACE 5 NO 6 CALLMEIFYOUNEEDME – WIN Stuart Pettigrew’s charge was considered an unlucky loser on debut when second to Leaving Las Vegas. Although she runs in a Listed feature race Pettigrew will not hear of her losing today. VALUE BET RACE 7 QUARTET: 1-RAIN 1N HOLLAND AND 9-EMERALD PRINCESS WITH THE FIELD TAB have been having a R100,000 carryover to Race 7 at four meetings over the weekend and followers of this column will have made money at Kenilworth yesterday when we caught their Race 7 Quartet which paid R8,415.  So we’ll try again for this meeting at Turffontein which sees last year’s Triple Tiara winner Rain In Holland attempt to get back on a winning track after a setback last year. Sean Tarry also saddles Emerald Princess who has to be a big runner in a highly competitive field. The cost of this bet is R1320 but once again, one can always take a percentage starting at 1% for R13.20 upwards.
