Saile had replaced Caleb Bomenyimana. “He gave us that extra oomph we were looking for,” Chiefs coach Arthur Zwane said in a TV interview after the game. “And we were so aggressive, we gave them no space, we were pressing them. “We knew that in the middle, we were in that mental battle. We just needed to be a little bit aggressive now going forward. “And when Saile came on, he gave us that and that’s why we managed to score the second goal,” added Zwane. Saile definitely ticked a few boxes in a performance that gave promising signs that he could be the real deal.  He will however have to fight for a place in the team against Caleb Bimenyimana who has already scored seven goals for Amakhosi.  Saile will have to shoulder the responsibility alone should Bimenyimana be injured again because Chiefs are thin in the striking department.  Ashely Du Preez is now played more as a winger than an outright striker under Zwane.  Here is a look at five aspects of the game which are needed in a striker and Saile ticked in the 35+ minutes he played on Sunday. You could sense that he wanted to make a good first impression but that didn’t make him unnecessarily overwork himself. In the assist for Du Preez’s goal, Saile could have gone on a run and tried to shoot himself.  ALSO READ: Chiefs’ Maart opens up about Puskas snub And completing that pass shows he is a good passer and crosser of the ball.
