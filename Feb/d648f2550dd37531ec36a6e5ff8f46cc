Despite the cut-off low having weakened significantly, there is a fresh rain system expected to move westwards in the coming days, warned the South African Weather Service (SAWS) on Monday. “This system is a so-called east wind wave and is likely to herald a further episode of persistent and sometimes heavy rain for the north-eastern and northern provinces, which are already saturated and rain-soaked, following the heavy rainfall of the past week,” said the weather service.  Persistent and heavy rain is expected to continue this week, especially over the Lowveld and along the escarpment areas of both Limpopo and Mpumalanga. An orange level 9 warning has been issued for Monday.

Other areas in Limpopo and Mpumalanga will also see showery conditions, which may result in flooding because soil moisture content is high, and catchment and river systems are full.
