BEST BET RACE 3 NO 1 YGRITTE – WIN This filly ran some decent races in Cape Town but was just unable to win a race. Her form looks far better than any other runner in the line-up and should finally crack her maiden win. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 2 IRISH RAIN – EACHWAY One often finds that bookmakers price up the form of trainers and jockeys above the form of the horse and that might be the case with Cliffie Miller’s charge. This five-year-old gelding has some of the best form in the race and is sitting at around 8-1.Irish Rain is perfectly drawn at No 3 and with Rachel Venniker claiming her 1.5kg allowance, that price looks excellent value.
