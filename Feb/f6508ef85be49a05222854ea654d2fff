His growth has been exceptional since joining Pirates youth from the Transnet School of Excellence and he was  training with the first team last week ahead of their Nedbank Cup clash with All Stars on Saturday. The 17-year old striker has impressed coach Jose Riveiro and the rest of his technical team, who believe that he is close to being ready to play senior football regularly and they will keep on monitoring him. “The plan was to introduce him in the Nedbank Cup, but the coaches had second thoughts about it,” said a source. “They like what they see from him, hence he was invited to train with the big boys.

There are just some minor things he needs to learn and once he gets that we will see more of him in the senior team.
