A total of 520 students from three universities have benefited from an innovation project that helps higher education institutions in Tanzania to move towards embracing innovation and entrepreneurship for socioeconomic good. Students from the Nelson Mandela African Academy of Science and Technology, the Sokoine University of Agriculture and the University of Iringa are beneficiaries of the two-year project funded by the French Embassy in Tanzania at a total cost of Sh1.4 billion. A Tanzanian firm, Sahara Ventures, is implementing the project that’s known as Innoversity. Speaking during a visit to Sahara Ventures offices in Dar es Salaam at the weekend, the Ambassador of France to Tanzania, Nabil Hajlaoui, said the Innoversity Project was part of his government’s commitment to promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in Tanzania by helping the youth to develop ideas and generate income through entrepreneurship. “What we are implementing is what we agreed with President Samia Suluhu Hassan in February 2022, when she came to Paris and visited a big incubator of startups, Station F. During that meeting, we decided to jointly share experience with our Tanzanian counterparts. We chose Sahara Ventures to work with us since they met all the standards we were looking for,” he said. Earlier, the Chief Executive Officer for Sahara Ventures, Jumanne Mtambalike, said in the implementation of the project they were offering various entrepreneurship skills to students while at the same time working with their lecturers to help them develop their innovative ideas. “We have worked with more than 500 students and 38 college lecturers and received applications from other colleges such as the State University of Zanzibar and Tumaini University Dar es Salaam College and we are working on their applications,” he said.
