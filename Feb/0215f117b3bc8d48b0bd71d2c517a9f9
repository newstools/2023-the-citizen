Angry residents barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks and allegedly torched the house belonging to the family of mayor Victoria de Beer. They appeared briefly on Wednesday in the Parys magistrate’s court on charges of arson and public violence where the case was postponed. In total 12 suspects were arrested on Tuesday for public violence and more arrests are reportedly expected as investigations continue. At the time, Free State premier Sisi Ntombela called for calm following the protests in Tumahole and Kroonstad. Ntombela called on residents, and particularly leaders of the protests, to ensure that discipline is maintained at all times to protect infrastructure. “Our people enjoy and are protected by certain rights, such as the right to peacefully protest. However, these rights should not be abused and impede on the rights of others,” she said.  ALSO READ: WATCH: Makro employees protest over wages
