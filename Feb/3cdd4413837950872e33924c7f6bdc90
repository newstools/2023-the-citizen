Dar es Salaam. Nutritional experts have warned against use of table salt, saying it is a dangerous habit that leads to diseases including high blood pressure and heart diseases. The nutritionists were speaking during the Mwananchi Twitter Space discussion which was held under the topic "How to avoid diseases caused by using table salt." Speaking in the debate, Nutrition expert from the World Food Organization (FAO), Stella Kimambo said it has become common to find salt on the table and someone even add it before they even tasting the food to determine if it is salty or not.  “It is common to find salt on every table at a hotel or restaurant, even in most homes today there is a tendency of having salt on the table with some adding before they taste the food,” she said. According to her it is easy for people to identify iodized salt because it is always written on the packets but even then salt remains a major health threat that people continue to ignore On his part, Paul James said that the only way to avoid diseases that are caused by excessive use of table salt is to educate and sensitise the population on the dangers of raw salt during meals. "The media and various academics should explain this carefully at various levels about the use of table salt. Students should also be taught about the dangers of consuming raw salt. It is only through such a sustained campaign that this habit can be changed. In the case of hotels even the waiters and waitresses should be armed with this knowledge,” he said
