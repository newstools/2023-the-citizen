Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) launched its next-gen virtual reality (VR) headset – the PlayStation VR2 – globally, including South Africa. It has advanced features, such as high-fidelity visuals and enhanced tracking, and aims to take VR gaming to a completely new level of awesomeness. With advanced features such as enhanced tracking and high-fidelity visuals, the VR2 aims to take virtual reality gaming to a whole new level, providing players with heightened sensations unlike any other. The VR2 headset is built on PlayStation 5 (PS5) architecture to create a fully-fledged virtual experience by combining 3D audio, eye tracking and and haptic feedback. The eye tracking feature, haptic feedback and adaptive triggers enable users to truly experience the game in a visceral way, such as feeling the tension of a bowstring. Meanwhile, finger touch detection allows for more natural gestures during gameplay and headset feedback amplifies the sensations of in-game actions. This means gamers will ‘feel’ a character’s pulse, for example. Coupled with 3D audio and OLED display support, the game will come alive in new and exciting ways. The OLED display supports 4K HDR video format, as well as buttery smooth frame rates of 90Hz/120Hz, and a 110-degree field of view. Sony also pays attention to detail, and the PlayStation VR2 is designed with comfort in mind, complete with an integrated air flow vent and a lens adjustment dial.
