Springbok wing Sbu Nkosi has been picked to play for the Bulls in their United Rugby Championship match against the Stormers at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. It will be Nkosi’s first match in months and since he admitted to struggling with mental health issues at the end of last year. Nkosi went AWOL from Loftus Versfeld in December, only to be found days later at his father’s house in Mpumalanga. 🔥 TEAM ANNOUNCEMENT 🔥 Here is YOUR Vodacom Bulls team to take on the DHL Stormers tomorrow at Loftus 💪 🚨 Sbu and Sheep make their much anticipated returns 👏 150 could be up for Morne Steyn 🎟 Tickets Here: https://t.co/C4mxQtucxX@Vodacom #URC pic.twitter.com/3i9i74NmO2 The Bok winger said he was struggling to deal with the pressures and expectations of being a professional sportsman.   Nkosi gets his chance again in the big north versus south derby because more recent Bok wingers Canan Moodie and Kurt-Lee Arendse are resting, according to national team protocols. In other significant Bulls team selections, lock Jacques du Plessis joins captain Ruan Nortje in the second row, while Wandisile Simelane will wear the No 13 jersey, with Cornal Hendricks on the wing.
