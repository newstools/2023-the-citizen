They see when players are giving everything for the badge. They know when we try to do everything in order to change results and I think they should be proud of the team and the players,” said the Bucs coach. The Pirates mentor was happy to have seen the club’s fans filling up their home ground and rallying behind the team from the first blow of the whistle to the last.
