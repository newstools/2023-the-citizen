Last Sunday marked my first night in Paris, and I must say, it is an unforgettable experience. As part of the French government’s “Future Leaders Personalities” programme, I have the opportunity to explore the city’s grandeur, passion for fine eating, and rich history. From the city of love and light to the intellectual luminaries that brought the world to the Age of Enlightenment, Paris is indeed a remarkable city. I feel extremely grateful for this opportunity, but to be honest, I didn’t need much encouragement to explore French culture. As someone who appreciates the nuances between a brasserie, bistro, café, and ristorante, any chance to delve into such knowledge is eagerly embraced by me. However, I don’t think the good people of France realise what the jinni they are unleashing by allowing me to do this. Parisian Sundays are generally peaceful, with the French being known for their 35-hour work weeks and laws prohibiting work-related emails outside business hours. Initially, I assumed that the French are not fond of work and prefer to indulge in leisure activities. However, considering that France ranks seventh in the world for productivity based on GDP per hour worked, ahead of countries like the US, the UK, and Japan, probably the French know what they are doing. Upon arrival, I wasted no time getting a personal feel of what Paris is myself. The weather was decent – I could get around without much trouble. However, being Black and not speaking French, I felt a bit uneasy venturing too far from my hotel in downtown Paris. Nonetheless, I met with Tanzanian embassy officials who assured me that I needn’t feel threatened in any way, and this put me more at ease. Paris is renowned for its vast array of experiences and landmarks, which leave lasting impressions on visitors. These include the Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower, the Champs-Elysees, the Louvre Museum, and the Pantheon, among others. I had always longed to see such grandeur and majesty, and Paris does not disappoint. Two days ago, I visited the Pantheon, which is located on the right bank of the River Seine. Built by King Louis XV in the 18th century, it was initially intended as a St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. The Pantheon is an impressive building, modelled after its more famous Greek cousin. However, due to the increasing anti-religious fervour after the French Revolution, the church was transformed into a mausoleum for France’s great men. Notably, the Pantheon houses the remains of prominent individuals such as Voltaire, Rousseau, and Victor Hugo. It is strange that some of Christianity’s greatest critics are honoured with a resting place in the church. The French are known for their affinity for grandeur, both in terms of physical infrastructure and intellectual pursuits. Their appreciation for greatness, eminence, and distinction is reflected in their cultural and social fabric, which is characterised by power, glory, and intellectual elevation. Paris, in particular, is a testament to this character, with its exceptional architecture, streets, and neighbourhoods, all evidencing the country’s enduring commitment to excellence. Paris, though, offers much more than mere physical grandeur. It is the birthplace of the Age of Enlightenment and a hub for theatres, operas, wine, fashion, cheese, and cuisine. These things have been elevated into fine art, attracting millions of visitors to indulge in them every year. Many years ago, I had the opportunity to attend a course by a Canadian scholar who spoke about the challenges of defining culture. Among the seven definitions that he presented, there was one that stuck with me because of how it brought together the intangible aspects of culture, such as beliefs and ideas, and the tangible aspects, that is, the products that society creates. In modern terms, the definition speaks of culture as both the software and hardware of the nation. I think there is often too much focus on the intangible aspects of culture, which can be quite misleading. Instead, the best way to determine if a society is culturally impoverished or enriched is by examining the products it produces, such as innovations, infrastructure, schools, and other tangible items. In that regard, the French have a rich culture that reflects their aspirations for excellence, beauty, and order. That heritage has shaped their identity and their worldview and may be a significant factor in their success as a nation. The French’s long history has shaped their culture and influenced their perspective on life. It is this unique fusion of history and culture that can serve as a powerful tool for driving a nation towards greater heights. As I write this, I cannot but reflect on the situation back home. I wonder what goes into the mind of a person who plans for a school without providing a solid solution for access to water and sanitation. I wonder what sort of service can be provided by members of institutions doing their business in decrepit buildings. I wonder what do we expect when we take the worst performers to enforce our laws? For some reason, everything we do feels temporal and expedient, as if the nation has no future. I have just come from a four-hour walk around Paris. I have seen a lot that is awesome. But for me, it is their wealth in culture that matters most. The buildings and architecture are not just relics of the past, but symbols of their aspirations for the future. It made me contemplate the legacy we are leaving behind for future generations. Will they be able to look back and find anything that can be attributed to our time, or will they have to start from scratch? There is a culture of poverty and poverty of culture. It is a devastating thing when the two combine. That’s why we have to think – what does our culture create? Are we creating a lasting impact? From the city of light, let me say – bonjour!
