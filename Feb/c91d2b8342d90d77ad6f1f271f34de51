Police have seized 378kg of pure cocaine worth R1.3 billion on a container ship at the Durban harbour in KwaZulu-Natal. The massive drug bust was carried out in the early hours of Friday morning, by customs officers of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and the South African Police Service (Saps). This followed a week-long intelligence-driven operation led by the Sars’ National Targeting Unit.

The containers were inspected after they were unloaded in the Durban harbour.  The inspection revealed zinc metal products and several black bags containing 378 bricks of pure cocaine. “The illicit cargo and what appears to be cellular tracking devices were handed over to Spas for further investigations,” Sars said in a statement.  Sars Commissioner Edward Kieswetter praised the well-coordinated work of all enforcement agencies involved in the operation. “By working together, government has shown once again that it is determined to fight the scourge of narcotics entering the country and destroying the lives of its users, especially the youth. “Sars will not tolerate these illegal activities but will rather continue to fulfill its mandate of facilitating legal trade to further the economic development of our country,” said Kieswetter.
