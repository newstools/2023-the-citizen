This group debunks the myth that healthy food is expensive as most are affordable and easy to purchase. Pulses are a source of protein, vitamins complex carbohydrates, and fibre. To make a hearty healthy dish in spells of cooler weather or rain, this plant-based shepherd’s pie has all your traditional ingredients but not minced meat.  The shepherd’s pie includes a plant-based minced that promises to taste the original.   ALSO TRY: Sunday recipe: Jamie Oliver’s 30 minute fish pie *This recipe is courtesy of proveg.com.
