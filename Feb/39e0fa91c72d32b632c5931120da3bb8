One of the women who was taken to court by DJ Fresh, Penny Lebyane, has spoken out after his latest comments on Podcast and Chill with MacG. DJ Fresh co-hosted the show, standing in for MacG who couldn’t host the show as he was suffering an eye infection. The hot topic of his legal battles against activists Ntsiki Mazwai and Penny Lebyane were brought up and DJ Fresh said the women didn’t apologise, however, one of them did pay up. Fresh said after they lost, Ntsiki paid his lawyers R80 000, however, Lebyane said she paid nothing towards that amount and didn’t take kindly of what the musician had said. Reacting DJ Fresh’s comments, the radio host immediately denied paying him or his lawyers any money. She took to her Twitter account on Tuesday to detail how she responded to her name being mentioned in Fresh’s lawsuit against Ntsiki, something she has addressed in the past. She wrote: “I didn’t pay anyone anything. Not a cent. I don’t have money to waste. First l was not a [respondent] in case. I filed to ask the court why my trading name Penny Lebyane is in paragraph 15 of an affidavit, which the response was it was a mistake, but l must pay for asking. I refused. “But that won’t be mentioned because it’s nothing to gloat about. I will stand in my truth as l always have. I just wish he would ‘Keep My Name Out Of His Mouth’ and stop policing my lived experience and centering himself. I have had so many DJ boyfriends honestly l have. “Just like l interviewed Lerato Moloi which l have a recording of the conversation, l never called anyone a “rapist” but it’s a better version to make me look irresponsible [because] it takes away my voice and credibility. Ultimately silences louder voices against injustice.” Personally victims come to me with their stories l don’t seek them. Males in entertainment industry came to me on what they witnessed or know but have no balls to speak up. So it’s easy to make me a Toilet Paper to wipe your secretion with. I won’t allow it. Never. I’d rather DIE— PennyLebyane💚PennyLebyaneDotAfrica (@PennyLebyane) January 31, 2023 Fresh also responded to reports that his lawsuit was defamation, however, he denied it after Zimoja shared an article claiming this. He said: “NOT TRUE!!!! There was zero mention of defamation. But we WILL open that door since you have pointed to it! Shot!! NOT TRUE!!!! There was zero mention of defamation.But we WILL open that door since you have pointed to it!! Shot 🙏🏾❤️— DJ Fresh (Big Dawg) (@DJFreshSA) January 31, 2023 The controversial poet stood her ground saying she was not taken to court over a “lie”. “What I know for a fact is that I’m not a liar… I know I expose uncomfortable truths… but a liar? Lol I can’t even lie with make-up and false illusions of beauty… so to expect to me have lied about such a big thing is really very fascinating for me. Is it denial,” her tweet read.                What I know for a fact is that im not a liar…….I know I expose uncomfortable truths….but a liar????
