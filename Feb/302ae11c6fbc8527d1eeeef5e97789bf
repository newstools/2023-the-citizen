We are here for the long term and it is evident in our recruitment and the promotion of young players.“Ours is to try and make sure that we do our best in every competition,” said Mokwena.Sundowns’ next opponents are Cotonsport who they take on this Friday in Cameroon. After that, Downs will travel to Egypt to face rivals and record holders, Al-Ahly.“We have already sent an advanced team to try and put more context to the logistics,” explained Mokwena.We are very experienced in that space and we have ticked a lot of boxes,” he added, but said his team were not entertaining any talk yet of where it’s best to finish in the group.In the past three seasons, Sundowns have finished at the summit of their group but always bombed out in the quarterfinals. Last season Bafana Ba Style succumbed to Petro Atletico while prior to that, Al-Ahly were their achilles heel.“We have two games coming and it is very important to try and put ourselves in a good position.“We have set objectives and we are moving towards them slowly. We have not spoken about whether we want to finish first or second but the important thing is that we try to win every game, because that is the culture of the club.“We are making slow improvements but it is good,” said the Sundowns mentor.
