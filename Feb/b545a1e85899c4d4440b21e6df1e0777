Flank Deon Fourie will captain the Stormers in their United Rugby Championship encounter with the Sharks in Durban on Saturday. The experienced Fourie leads a team which has been boosted by the inclusion of a number of key players for the coastal clash, which kicks off at 2pm at Kings Park. In the backline, wing Seabelo Senatla makes his reurn from injury, while fullback Clayton Blommetjies, inside centre Dan du Plessis, flyhalf Manie Libbok and scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies all join him in the starting line-up. Up front hooker Joseph Dweba, prop Neethling Fouche and Fourie all come back after resting last week, while lock Gary Porter returns from injury to partner Ruben van Heerden in the second row. Marcel Theunissen will be at the back of the scrum, with Junior Pokomela back in the mix at blindside flank.
