After its golden era during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, banana bread isn’t as popular as it was during this time, however, a dedicated day has made sure we still whip up this classic sweet loaf bread.  National Banana Bread Day, on 23 February, is recognised largely in the United States, but it is still marked worldwide. On this day, bakers are urged to make this sweet and delicious quick bread that is also cake-like but considerably moister.  It is a fantastic snack with a cup of tea or to start your day, it does have bananas after all making it a little healthier.  This banana recipe has a bit of a twist with a cinnamon swirl batter inspired by cinnamon buns, adding extra sweetness. Use ripe bananas to achieve the moist texture of well-baked banana bread.  ALSO TRY: Recipe of the day: Deliciously sweet Nutella banana bread recipe *This recipe can be found at thebakermama.com.
