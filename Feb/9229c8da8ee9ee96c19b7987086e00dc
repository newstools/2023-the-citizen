City Power on Thursday confirmed that the theft of a 17-metre cable on Saayman Road in Roodepoort caused a power outage in several neighbourhoods.  The incident is believed to have occurred late Wednesday night and exacerbated City Power’s existing challenges – ageing infrastructure and vandalism.  City Power said Radiokop, Honeydew, and Boothill may experience power outages, however, operators assessed the damage on Thursday and replace the stolen cables.  They plan to replace the stolen goods and conduct final tests, with the goal of restoring power by throughout the course of today (Friday).  Still, City Power said the time of restoration is subject to everything going according to plan. Meanwhile, the repairs were placed on hold during load shedding.  City Power appeals to the public to report any incidents of theft or vandalism to their local police station, or report irregular activity on citypower.mobi.
