Dar es Salaam. 4.3 and 4.9-magnitude earthquakes have struck central Tanzania in the Dodoma and Singida regions, the Geological Survey of Tanzania (GST) has confirmed. No deaths, injuries, or destruction of property have been reported so far. According to a statement by GST, the earthquakes occurred on February 16 and 17, 2023, in the two regions, respectively, and caused fear among residents of the regions and neighbouring areas. "Singida and Dodoma regions are crossed by the rift valley of East Africa. The areas of the rift valley are usually fragile areas of geological change that suffer from earthquakes and volcanic eruptions," the statement reads in part. The statement comes three days after it was reported that an earthquake with a magnitude of 4.7 hit the Tanga and Pemba regions.
