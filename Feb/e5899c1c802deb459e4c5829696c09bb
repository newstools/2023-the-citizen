Dar es Salaam. DCB Commercial Bank Plc has cemented its mid-sized position in the banking sector with a steady growth of its balance sheet and an increase in profits, its financial report shows. The bank, which is listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), registered a profit before tax of Sh2.25 billion in 2022, according to the recently released financial results. This was an increase of 112 per cent compared to a profit before tax of Sh1.06 billion for the year 2021.
