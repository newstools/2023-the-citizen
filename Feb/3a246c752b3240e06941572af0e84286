Jankielsohn received seven votes from Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) out of the 30 votes cast. Six MPLs abstained from the voting process. Addressing MPLs shortly after he was sworn in, Dukwana thanked all those who elected him into office and promised to deal with the province’s governance challenges, such as fast-tracking service delivery to communities.  The newly elected premier also promised to tackle crime and corruption. “What I do not take for granted is that this day belongs to the people of our province. It is the day of hope and restoration. It is a day to reclaim our glory and our pride,” said Dukwana. Dukwana’s accession to the top of the Free State provincial government followed the ANC’s decision to recall Sisi Ntombela as premier.  Ntombela resigned from the position this week. Last month, Ntombela lost the contest for the position of ANC provincial chairperson to Dukwana at the 9th Free State provincial conference.
