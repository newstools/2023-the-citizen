Hundreds of residents have been evacuated from Komani (formerly Queenstown) after heavy overnight rains caused flooding in the Eastern Cape town. The heavy rainfall led to the Komani River overflowing. There doesn’t seem to be any respite either. An orange level-5 warning for disruptive rain was issued by the South African Weather Service (Saws) on Wednesday.

Patients who were due to be discharged today were discharged. As the flooding has affected the ground floor, this has necessitated the hospital’s functioning on reduced occupancies. Emergency treatment is sustained, and all essential services are functional,” Moavodi told City Press. Dr Nikelo Mabandla, a radiologist at the hospital, said the machinery in the hospital is at risk of being damaged. He blamed the lack of maintenance on the town’s drainage systems. “This is what happens when water drainage system is ignored & flood lines disrespected,” he tweeted.
