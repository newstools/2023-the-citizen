With extensive plans for the South African market currently underfoot, Mitsubishi has started the year off with the introduction of a new flagship variant of the Eclipse Cross positioned above the existing GLS derivatives. The recipient of the Exceed suffix, thus becoming the GLS Exceed, the newcomer differs little outwardly from its siblings as the entire range benefitted from an extensive mid-life overhaul less than three years ago.

The rest of the spec sheet is unaltered from the regular GLS and therefore includes a Head-Up Display, automatic air-conditioning with rear vents, 18-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry and push-button, an eight-speaker sound system, plus: Streamlined in 2021 with the removal of the all-wheel-drive model, the GLS Exceed’s powertrain is also unchanged with outputs of 110kW/250Nm from the 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine. A CVT remains the sole transmission option for the 1.5 and entry-level normally aspirated 2.0-litre petrol that produces 110kW/197Nm.  Claimed fuel consumption is 7.7 L/100 km for the turbo and 7.9 L/100 km for 2.0-litre with both sporting a ground clearance of 180mm. As with its siblings, boot space in the GLS Exceed ranges from 437 litres with the rear seats up, to 1 074 litres with the 60/40 split rear back folded down. Available in five colours; Silky White Pearl, Sterling Silver Metallic, Titanium Grey Metallic, Sporty Blue and Red Diamond, the Eclipse Cross GLS Exceed’s price tag includes a three-year/100 000 km warranty as well as a five-year/90 000 km service plan.
