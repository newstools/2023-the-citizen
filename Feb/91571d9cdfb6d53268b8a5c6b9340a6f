Former Joburg mayor Dr Mpho Phalatse has called the recommendations to investigate her a witch-hunt and a corrupt move by a coalition led by the ANC and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).  On Wednesday, council speaker Colleen Makhubele recommended Phalatse be investigated for improper conduct after she allegedly concealed a report which cleared former acting city manager Floyd Brink of any wrongdoing.

However, Phalatse allegedly concealed the second report from the council, which disqualified Brink from being hired permanently as a city manager. Phalatse said the allegations were false.  “I will be taking this up. I do not want to speak to the media at this moment because I am still speaking to lawyers. What they want to do is very corrupt and we are going to expose it. Watch this space,” she said.
