It’s a big year for the team, the World Cup is coming up and we need to make sure that we are ready,” said Ellis. “I am really happy with what I saw from the players, we created chances and we managed to utilise them, especially in our first game. That is a good thing for the team because we used to create a number of opportunities and end up not taking them. But, there is always room for improvement and I believe the girls know that they have to work hard in order to compete against the best teams in the world.” ALSO READ: Pirates to stop Chiefs’ Soweto derby record chase – Mabena The Banyana mentor also praised the South African Football Association (Safa) and the team’s sponsors Sasol for accepting the invite to play in the tournament and she is adamant that it will come in handy for the team. “The Association is trying very hard to make sure that we are ready when the World Cup starts, as well as our sponsors.
