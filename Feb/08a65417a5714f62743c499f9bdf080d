Dar es Salaam. Dar es Salaam. President Samia Suluhu Hassan has revealed that one of the reasons for the cabinet reshuffle is quarrels among ministers and permanent secretaries.  According to her, she has been forced to make minor reshuffles in her cabinet is to avoid conflicts between ministers, deputy ministers, and PSs. Samia’s caution comes a day after a minor ministerial reshuffle, which saw new allocations and new faces taking on hefty roles.  Samia was speaking on Monday, February 27, during the swearing in ceremony of the newly appointed officials at Dodoma State House. One minister, two deputy ministers, and two permanent secretaries and their deputies were sworn in today. They were appointed in latest changes made by the president. "Though I do not like to talk about it, I have to say it is because sometimes I wonder if the work is not done, so you have to make changes. I want to tell you this is the last time I will make a reshuffle because if I do so, it is like I am entertaining you," she said. She added: If it happens again I will remove all the officials involved in that acts, If I appoint you to go and work, I do not see a reason for you to fight. However, the president did not go into details into the matter, saying they will discuss when she meets the cabinet, the PS and the deputy PS in a three-day meeting to be held it in Arusha. Also, she said changes in government are normal and that in the next two years, there will be a timely reshuffle whenever she sees the need.
