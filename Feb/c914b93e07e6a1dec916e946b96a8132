Dar es Salaam. Tanzania is fast-tracking a policy to support In vitro fertilisation (IVF) activities in order to help people with fertility problems to have babies. Being one of the several techniques that are used to help people with fertility problems to have babies, the IVF is conducted in such a way that an egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop. Gracing the inauguration of the Kairuki Green IVF Clinic in Dar es Salaam on Monday, February 6, 2023, Health minister Ummy Mwalimu said though there was currently no guidelines for delivery of IVF services in the country, the policy to that goal would be ready within one month. “I have directed the responsible people to work closely with other health experts and the management of Kairuki Hospital to make sure that we get the policy within one month,” said Ms Mwalimu. Earlier, a super specialist in Clinical Embryology at Kairuki Hospital, Dr Clementina Kairuki, said a non-published research that was conducted in 2016 revealed that in Tanzania, 30 percent of the people in the child-bearing age had infertility issues. “This calls for serious steps for the government to invest in doing national research to identify the right statistics of how big this problem is,” she said. According to Dr Kairuki, the Kairuki Hospital has invested Sh4.5 billion in setting up the facility and so far, it has attended to 600. Out of the number, 45 people have gone for IVF whereby 35 have been successful. The facility is able to accommodate up to 1,000 people per year.
