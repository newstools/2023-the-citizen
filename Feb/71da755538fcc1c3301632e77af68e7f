Shinyanga. Mining activities in the gold rich Lake Zone regions of Geita and Shinyanga are making a profound impact on neighbouring communities, a senior government official said here at the weekend. The director of Policy and Planning in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government), Mr John Cheyo said this here at the weekend, who visited several projects that have been built by corporate social responsibility funds from the Barrick Bulyanhulu Gold Mine in Msalala and Nyang’hwale councils urged members of the public to make good use of the projects run by investors. “I am happy to see that these projects have been executed and are well supervised… I call on the users of buildings and equipment purchased in hospitals to take good care of them so that they last long and continue to serve more people in the long term,” he said. During the visit, Mr Cheyo and his delegation went to Kharumwa English Medium School, Mwingiro, Kayenze, Igalula, Busulwangili, Bugarama schools where classrooms and laboratories are being built or improved. The delegation also visited Bugarama Vocational Education Training Centre, Ntobo Nursing College and Bugarama Health Centre among others that are beneficiaries of the Barrick Bulyanhulu’s Corporate Social Responsibility funds. Mr Cheyo said it was encouraging to see that various projects have been completed and that the education and health infrastructures have been built to satisfactory levels. According to Barrick Bulyanhulu’s acting manager for Community Relations and Environment, Zuwena Senkondo, once the projects have been approved by the relevant council, the mine immediately provides funds in line with the scheduled time of the implementation.
