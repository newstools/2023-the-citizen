ChatGPT, OpenAI’s artificial intelligence-powered chatbot, began experiencing outages which go beyond the platform’s regular capacity limits. Users were flocking to Twitter on Monday evening, contemplating the meaning of their existence while hitting refresh repeatedly. OpenAI said it was aware of the timeout error.  At the time of publishing, ChatGPT was “starting to improve after initial fixes” were implemented.  However, as of 7:40 pm local time, the services were still unavailable to thousands. The status of the outage is currently flagged as under investigation. OpenAI said: “We are still seeing database instabilities. We have restored partial traffic to the site; however, we are still seeing many people having trouble accessing the site.” Our team is continuing to actively investigate the issue. I considered tweeting a quirky joke about the outage, but I’ve been using ChatGPT for my social media management… ALSO READ: LLaMA vs ChatGPT?: Meta’s solution to AI dangers This is the first widespread outage since both free and premium plans went down on 14 February, and again on 21 February. #ChatGPT down, 10 million people restarting their brains in the hopes it still works 😂— Warren Manuel (@WarrenCManuel) February 27, 2023 For those of us who see patterns everywhere, yes, it’s seven days. Ironically, the Valentine’s Day outages were resolved within seven minutes. At the time of publishing, the outage has been frustrating users for a good and solid two hours and 40 minutes. ChatGPT is down. I feel paralysed.— David Ronan (Daithí Ó Rónán) (@daithibowzy) February 27, 2023 Me when #chatGPT is down.
