Marie biscuits are a firm favourite amongst South Africans as a simple teatime treat. However, they are very versatile when it comes to turning them into desserts, especially the childhood favourite of Marie biscuits chocolate squares.  For some, these squares conjure up memories dating back to their primary and high school days when learners who were squires and debs raised funds for their school, a ball or a charity event they were organising.  To raise the money they would sell them for R5 for one Marie biscuit chocolate square over 10 years ago. Who knows how much they cost now? A whole bucket load would be finished by midday. To get some nostalgia you can easily make a bulk of these at home.  This recipe can be made tenfold. This dessert or treat is electricity-friendly: you won’t need to use the oven or any mixer to make them. However, if you want them to harden quicker, you can pop them in the fridge for a few hours.  ALSO TRY: Saturday treat: Delicious apple pie recipe with a spicy filling Notes* You can add nuts to your chocolate squares and if you are experimental try other biscuits such as shortbread, Tennis biscuits or oat crunchies.
