The Wanderers was not even fit for garden cricket as rain poured down over Johannesburg on Saturday, leading to the SA20 final being postponed until Sunday’s reserve day, starting at 1.30pm. Over 200ml of rain has fallen over the last three days and SA20 Commissioner Graeme Smith said their weather consultants had advised that further heavy showers would fall on Saturday afternoon, causing them to postpone the final around midday, hours before the scheduled 4.30pm start. The weather forecast is better for Sunday afternoon, and both the Pretoria Capitals and Sunrisers Eastern Cape would rather play a full 20-over game on Sunday than perhaps a shortened five-over lottery on Saturday evening.

I’m glad we made the right call and hopefully we can still have a memorable final,” Smith said. All tickets will be valid for the reserve day, with gates opening at 10.30am.
