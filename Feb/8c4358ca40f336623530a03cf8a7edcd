The tournament is scheduled to be played between 13 February and 23 February, with the South African senior women’s team set to kick-start their campaign with a clash against hosts Turkey on 15 February, followed by a meeting with Uzbekistan three days later and their final game will be against Venezuela on 21 February. Despite the uncertainty, coach Desiree Ellis on Monday announced a squad that will be participating at the tournament, and says they will keep on preparing for the tournament while waiting on confirmation on whether the competition will continue as scheduled or not. “I would like to pass on my condolences to Turkey and Syria with the recent earthquake that just happened,” said Ellis before announcing the squad for the tournament. “We are waiting on the embassy and the organisers to give us new feedback and developments. But as of now, we’ll be preparing for the Turkish Cup.” The Banyana coach believes the Turkish Cup is a right platform for her charges to prepare for the upcoming Fifa Women’s World Cup.
