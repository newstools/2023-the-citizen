Dar es Salaam. Tanzanian financial institutions that are set to participate in the upcoming EU-Tanzania business forum would have a unique opportunity to seal deals with their European counterparts, the EU’s deputy head of delegation, Mr Emilio Rossetti, said yesterday. Speaking about the forum, which will likely host over 600 attendees, Mr Rossetti said companies could anticipate news about new financing alternatives that will support entrepreneurs. “It is something to look forward to during the forum. There are opportunities for financing and support for investments,” he said. The forum, which is taking place from February 23rd-24th, 2023, in Dar es Salaam, is designed for the private and public sectors to network and exchange experiences. Participants will also get the chance to interact with decision-makers and match with potential investors in order to showcase and comprehend the opportunities for both private and public investment in Tanzania. “It is important to leverage the government’s efforts by increasing private sector investments in strategic sectors for sustainable development,” he noted. “Achieving sustainable development goals is improbable with only public funds, and this is why the private sector is at the heart of the global gateway, the EU’s positive offer to boost investments globally,” Mr Rossetti added. The Minister for Investment, Industry, and Trade, Dr Ashatu Kijaji, said this forum will offer Tanzanians an opportunity to attract more European investments, technology, and expertise to Tanzania.
