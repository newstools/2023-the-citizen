The eight men convicted in connection with the killing of nine residents from Glebelands hostel and the wounding of seven others have been handed down several sentences, including life in prison.  The hitmen were found guilty in October last year, on various counts of – among others – murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder – for offences that took place at the notorious hostel in Umlazi, south-west of Durban, between August 2014 and March 2016. This followed a protracted trial that started in 2018.

The men, who all lived at Glebelands hostel, conspired with each other to eliminate or kill residents of the hostel who threatened their control of the building. Their actions claimed the lives of Siniko Ncayiyane, Thulani Kati, Sipho Ndovela, Themba Pina, Nkosinathi Ndovela, William Mthembu, Thokozani Machi, Mzwandile Gawuza and Lucky Mtwa. Seven others were injured, resulting in the attempted murder charges. Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Nkosinathi Chili on Thursday handed down the sentences to the eight men. In sentencing them, Judge Chili imposed a term of life imprisonment for each count of murder, and where there was more than one count, the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. Regarding the attempted murder charges, the judge found that the men were awaiting trial for an excess of five years.  “Therefore, the court imposed a sentence of 10 years imprisonment, where five years were suspended for a period of five years,” said the NPA’s spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara.
