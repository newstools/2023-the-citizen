Motorists’ joy at being spared an increase in the general fuel levy and Road Accident Fund during Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s 2023 budget speech turned out to be short-lived as they are hit with yet another petrol price increase from Wednesday. Due to the Rand’s depreciation against the US Dollar, both grades of petrol go up by R1.27 at midnight tonight. The Inland price for a litre of 93 octane will be R22.65, while a litre of 95 octane will retail for R22.95. The wholesale price for 50ppm diesel is set to increase by 31 cents to R21.63. The Citizen Motoring has worked out how much more you’ll have to fork out for a tank of fuel in six of the most popular cars. The indicated prices as based on filling the tank from completely empty. The little hatchback’s 35-litre fuel tank will cost R34 more to fill in March than it did in February using 93 octane at Inland rates. If you fill up four times a month, your petrol bill will increase R136 this month. The Korean carmaker claims that the Picanto only sips five litres for every 100km, giving it a range of 700km. This means that every kilometer will cost R1.13. Filling this SUV’s 51-litre petrol tank with 93 octane has increased by R65, which means that it will cost owners that fill up four times a month R230 more this month. A kilometer will out work out to R1.58 based on the Chinese manufacturer’s fuel consumption claim of 7L/100km which will give a range of 729km.
