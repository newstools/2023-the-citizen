The memorial service of rapper Kiernan Jarryd Forbes, popularly known as AKA, at the Sandton Convention Centre on Friday got under way after nearly an hour-and-a-half delay.  Fellow rapper and TV presenter Nomuzi Mabena, popularly known as Moozlie, started off the proceedings as the MC as thousands gathered to celebrate the late rapper in the packed hall.  Attendees included the Forbes family, AKA’s father Tony, mother Lynn, his brother Steffan, Brittany Smith, girlfriend Nadia Nakai, DJ Zinhle, their daughter Kairo Forbes and Pearl Thusi’s daughter Thando Mokoena.  The family were emotional during the touching memorial celebrating AKA’s life. Most of them were dressed in black T-shirts that read out the words: “Long live Supa Mega, live long.” Kabelo Mabalane started the memorial with prayer, and revealed he was AKA’s spiritual mentor. He also told the mourners he used to lead home cell groups attended by AKA.  The Kwaito legend said the rapper also brought his partner Nadia Nakai along to the last group he attended before he was murdered.  In Mabalane’s prayer request, he said he hoped that AKA’s last album, Mass Country, becomes successful.  The crowd has filed inside, almost an hour after the published start time #akamemorialservice #thecitizenlifestyle pic.twitter.com/s4wSsJs1l2— All4Women.co.za (@all4women) February 17, 2023 There were emotive musical performances from Langa Mavuso, Sjava and Joyous Celebration. The award-winning choir sang their collaboration with AKA for the first time, as their song will feature on Mass Country.

In her message to his fans, the Megacy, she said: “Today going forward it will not just be about me and the rest of our family, extended family and friends. It will be about the Megacy as our broader family. I believe that is what Kiernan would have wanted.

She also said her son never wanted to produce mediocre music and he would want them to carry on his legacy. Lynn said Nadia and Zinhle would always be her daughters, and that she doesn’t care what social media says about them. “They don’t matter, the Megacy matters.” She concluded: “Don Design, you are my son. I love you.” "Don Design, my son, I love you," says Lynn Forbes #akamemorialservice— All4Women.co.za (@all4women) February 17, 2023 Friend Tshiamo Letshwene explained how the now infamous photo taken by Thotloetso Kutlwano Mogotsi, in which AKA is looking up with a halo effect, was taken two days before his death.  Letshwene says the hip hop star centred spirituality in his life, as they would pray before every performance and had various spiritual fathers, which included Mabalane.  “He knew God and he had a personal relationship,” he said, explaining the photograph was a reflection of his spiritual journey.  “This for me [the photo], the way I interpret it, is the heavens receiving him. That was his last photoshoot ever.” Another close friend and part of his team, Mahlatse ‘Zazboy’ Sethole, gave an insight into AKA’s work ethic, entrepreneurial spirit and how his brand changed the hip hop game forever.  Zazboy said AKA helped commercialise hip hop artists who had been struggling to make financial gains in music.   JR Bogopa also shared his memories and said hey had many after-hour calls, looked back at their music collaboration and how a city like Durban, which he loved would be the one to take him.  Idols SA judge, producer and frequent AKA collaborator JR speaks about his friend, Kiernan and how hard it is to comprehend that a city (Durban) that the late rapper loved would be the one that would take him away from the world #akamemorialservice #thecitizenlifestyle pic.twitter.com/wu2QAk7Z8i— All4Women.co.za (@all4women) February 17, 2023 Another speaker, artist Yanga Chief thanked Nadia for being in AKA’s life as he felt she saved his life.
