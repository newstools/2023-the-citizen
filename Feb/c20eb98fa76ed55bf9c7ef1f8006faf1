BEST BET RACE 6 NO 13 EL DANTE – WIN There is a lot to like about MJ Odendaal’s lightly raced five-year-old gelding who won impressively last time in his first start over 1600m. It was at this track and it was by 6.40 lengths.  The only concern is the wide No 13 draw but he does appear to have the necessary gate speed to overcome it. Keagan de Melo takes the ride. VALUE BET RACE 4 NO 5 GOLD INDEX – EACHWAY This three-year-old gelding has only run twice, both over 1200m, and put up two promising performances. He should relish the additional 200m and has been fitted with blinkers. BEST BET RACE 9 NO 5 CELTIC RUMOURS – WIN This three-year-old looks to be getting better with every run and will love the return to 1400m for this race. Gavin Lerena rides. VALUE BET JACKPOT 1 – RACES 1 TO 4 R192 Leg 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 Leg 2: 1, 2 Leg 3: 8, 9, 11 Leg 4: 1, 2, 3, 6 There are three Jackpots on offer at this evening’s meeting – Races 1 to 4, Race 5 to 8 and Races 8 to 11 – and two BiPots – Races 2 to 7 and Races 6 to 11.  Jackpot 1 looks particularly interesting and catchable so it could get bettors off to a winning start in this 11-race card.
