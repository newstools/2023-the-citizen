What an incredible tournament the inaugural SA20 has been. Cricket South Africa tried on several occasions in the past to get a twenty20 competition off the ground, to become a genuine global player in the 20-overs format, but failed every time, for various reasons.  Now, finally, they hit the jackpot.  With former captain Graeme Smith steering the ship, the competition has soared and all that is now left is for South Africa and the world to be thrilled by the final – at the Wanderers today.

The fans have embraced it and the players have loved it.  Finally, South Africa has its own global T20 competition on the cricket calendar and after this year’s success, we are sure that it will be even bigger and better next year.  Good luck to the Pretoria Capitals and the Sunrisers Eastern Cape, who will play in the final at the Wanderers, which is expected to be filled to capacity.
