Reports that modern markets around Dar es Salaam have turned into white elephants are disheartening. A survey by MCL shows that the facilities, built using billions of shillings of tax payer money, are either half empty or totally deserted by traders. The modern markets that are operating way below capacity and which were surveyed and a special report published on February 11, 2023 by Mwananchi include Kijichi Business Complex and Mbagala Kuu’s Simbwe Street Market in Temeke District. Others are Bwawani Market in Kinondoni District, Bombom Market and Machinga Complex in Ilala District. Traders and entrepreneurs who were allocated stalls in the markets say they left because of lack of customers. They also mentioned other factors as inadequate electricity billing system, exorbitant rental fees and remoteness of the facilities. The situation in Shimbwe Street Market, which has been closed down, is the most interesting. Traders who vacated the complex have moved to a nearby privately-owned plot along the Ng’ombe Road, where they are now plying their trade in run down conditions. But what is unfortunate about the whole affair is the failure by city authorities to learn from past mistakes. A decade ago the first modern market, Machinga Complex, was opened with fanfare. It was built to accommodate more than 10,000 hawkers who had been scattered all around the Kariakoo Business District. These refused to move into the facility, and the few who did, eventually left. To date the complex is only partially used. And city authorities proceeded to build other complexes repeating the main mistake of the Machinga Complex, which was lack of involvement of the traders from the design aspect of the project. City authorities should understand that there is no way that the markets will remain white elephants forever. Everything possible should be done to ensure that the facilities are effectively put to use to justify the billions of shillings invested in their construction.
