Speaking to The Citizen, forensic accident investigator Stan Bezuidenhout said it was a mini fuel tanker, being pulled by a bakkie that caught alight.  “The cause of the burn can only be speculation at this time and the versions are its gasoline on a trailer [being pulled] by a bakkie,” said Bezuidenhout. “If there was an explosion, it would have been minor – less severe than a tanker explosion.” Emer-G-Med confirmed that one person was injured and was treated for moderate injuries before they were transported via ambulance to a nearby hospital for further care.
