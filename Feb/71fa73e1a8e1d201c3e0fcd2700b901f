Dar es Salaam. The challenge of delivering heavy loads equipment to the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project has finally been resolved, thanks to the intervention by Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (Tazara). The launch of railway well-wagon services by Tazara yesterday gives hope that the 2,115 Megawatts hydropower project will expedited as the railway company will now be able to transport cargo of up to 200 tonnes at a time. The director of transport services from the Ministry of Works and Transport, Mr Aron Kisaka said that the wagon would enhance transportation of cargo from Dar es Salaam to Rufiji where the $2.9 billion project is currently being executed. “One of the biggest challenges we faced was the lack of heavy duty machinery to transport cargo. The wagon will reduce transportation costs and improve delivery times because it can carry heavy loads at once and it can operate in different environmental conditions,” he said. He said upon completion of the Julius Nyerere Hydro Project, the railway well-wagon will still be used to transport other heavy loads equipment to different regions of the country. “Since the hydropower project started in 2018, the government has granted Tazara $5.6 million to enable it to renovate staff houses and rehabilitation at Fuga to enable transportation and unloading of equipment,” he said. The Tazara chief executive officer, Mr Bruno Chingandu said the investment done by the Tanzania government helped their continuous efforts to modernize railway service delivery. “I am happy to say that since 2018 when the project started, we have so far transported over 200,000 tonnes of various project materials being utilized in the construction of the dam for the hydro-electric power plant,” he said. The $700,000 railway well-wagon has been manufactured and supplied by China railway rolling stock corporation (CRRC) through financing arrangement with JV Arabs contractors and National Bank of Commerce NBC.
