Lions boss Rudolf Straeuli has denied that a reported survey of coaches and management staff was driven by him but says he will deal with any player unhappiness in the camp. This comes after a report that a recent survey of the squad returned a disappointing appraisal of the Lions coaching and management team. According to IOL Sport, head coach Ivan van Rooyen only earned a rating of “between three and four out of 10″. Straeuli, who was reportedly not included in the survey, explained that it was all part of the regular operations by the players’ organisation MyPlayers and that similar surveys are conducted at other rugby unions. The Lions chief executive claimed that he had not seen the results, but would deal with any administrative issues causing unhappiness among the players.

When that survey comes back to me and there is unhappiness I will deal with it. “I won’t sweep it under the carpet.” Straeuli said that the Lions are in the process of extending player contracts and that the number of players signing on was an indication of overall happiness with how things are run at Ellis Park. “They see their future here at the Lions,” he added.
