Sundowns let a lead slip in a thrilling Group B encounter against Al-Ahly, and saw themselves trailing until Morena came off the bench to level matters for Rulani Mokwena’s side, making sure that Downs returned to the country with a point as the contest finished in a 2-2 draw.“It was difficult to have Thapelo on the bench for this game because he has been good for us. He came in with an important goal and that shows that he is a top footballer with an incredible attitude,” said Sundowns head coach Mokwena.“Al-Ahly made us work really hard for the point. We wanted three points but it is never easy against Al-Ahly and we had to give them a lot of respect,” he added. Downs still sit at the summit of Group B with seven points.

However, Marumo coach Raymond Mdaka believes that the tables will turn when Alger visit this country next week.“It was a good game and we learnt a number of things. We don’t underestimate them, they are a good team but with what we have seen, we will be able to deal with them better when we play them in the second round.“One thing for sure is that the approach might be very different from how we played against them in this past game.”“This place is cold, it is not as hot as South Africa. When they come to us, it will be very different weather, which might work to our advantage,” added Mdaka.
