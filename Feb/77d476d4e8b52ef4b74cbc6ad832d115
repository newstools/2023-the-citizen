Israeli actress, Gal Gadot headed to Seychelles with her friends for a much-needed break. The beautiful island with its clear blue waters and white sandy beaches is a remote archipelago made up of more than 100 islands, hidden in the vastness of the Indian Ocean, a very fitting break-away destination for ‘Wonder Woman’. The actress, who is also a model, singer and martial artist spend her sunny days on the island sipping on cocktails, lounging on the beach and sailing the waters around the island with her friends – Rotem Sela, Liron Weizman, Yael Goldman and Meital Weinberg Adar. The group stayed in a villa at the luxurious Club Med Seychelles Exclusive Collection resort which is found on the 220-hectare private island of Sainte Anne.
