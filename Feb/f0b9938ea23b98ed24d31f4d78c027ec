The stadium is mainly used for NRL matches, but did serve as Moana Pasifika’s home ground during the 2022 Super Rugby season. Meanwhile, the Bledisloe Cup Test against the Wallabies returns to Dunedin for the first time since 2017, in a rare afternoon home Test match that will kick off at 2.35pm (3.30am SA time) on 5 August. “The Rugby Championship is an exciting but tough draw,” said All Blacks coach Ian Foster. “Playing the Argentinians in Argentina is an exciting challenge after not being there since 2019. With the challenges of stadium availability in Australasia, we are delighted to play this huge South African Test at Mt Smart.
