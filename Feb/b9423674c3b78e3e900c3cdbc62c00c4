A daring suspect, who had previously been released on bail for attempting to bribe a police officer, was again arrested for the very same offence, this time trying to bribe a public prosecutor in Bloemfontein. The incident occurred on Monday, 20 February 2023, when the suspect approached a prosecutor and asked them to make a case against them “go away”. The suspect was initially facing charges of corruption and was previously released on bail after being arrested for handing money to a police official in an attempt to get a detained friend released. Following the prosecutor’s report of the bribe attempt, an operation was launched, and the suspect was arrested for the second time after he was caught paying a bribe to the prosecutor. The 40-year-old accused has been detained and is set to appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, 22 February 2023. Meanwhile, in a separate incident, three police officers were convicted of corruption on Monday, 20 February 2023, by the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. The officers were charged after they demanded a bribe from a suspect who was found with drugs in his vehicle. The police officers stopped the suspect at a roadblock. After searching his vehicle, they found drugs and placed the suspect under arrest. However, on the way to the police station, the members offered to release him if he paid a R5 000 bribe.
