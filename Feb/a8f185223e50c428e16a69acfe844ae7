Temba Bavuma has been named the new Proteas Test captain, taking over from Dean Elgar. Bavuma will also continue to lead the ODI side, but he has given up the T20 side’s captaincy. The new T20 captain will be named in the coming days. Elgar, who led the side in 15 Tests in two years, will continue to be available for the Test team. Bavuma’s first assignment as Proteas Test skipper will be to lead the side in a two-Test series against the West Indies from 28 February to 12 March. The new-look Proteas Test squad under the guidance of new coach Shukri Conrad also features Ryan Rickelton and Aiden Markram. Batter Tony de Zorzi, with 489 runs at an average of 122.25 in first class cricket this season, and fast bowler Gerald Coetzee have also been called up to the Test team, for the first time.
