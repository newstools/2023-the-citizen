There are coaches who talk about the referees in every post-match press conference. We hope he is the first step towards getting VAR to the country,” said Davids. “We need VAR here to be able to again be among the top leagues in the world. At the moment that is what we are lacking. Let’s hope his appointment pushes in the first step of acquiring VAR. That will definitely improve refereeing and will improve the decisions percentage being correct.” Meanwhile, while some of the best leagues in the world utilise VAR, there has been a recent uproar regarding the technology, which has caused a lot of debate around the world.
