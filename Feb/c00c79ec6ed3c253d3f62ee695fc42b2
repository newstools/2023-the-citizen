The launch of Kairuki Hospital Green IVF on Monday has put the problem of infertility in Tanzania on the limelight. Although it is a global issue there are indications that the magnitude of the problem is bigger than previously thought. Unofficial surveys already point to the fact that 30 per cent of people of child-bearing age could be infertile in the country. Only further research can determine the real extent of the problem. But as further studies on the issue continue, stakeholders from the private and public sectors should start taking action immediately to reduce infertility issues among Tanzanians. The World Health Organization says environmental and lifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity can affect fertility. Exposure to pollution and toxins can also cause problems with female eggs and male sperms leading to infertility. These are issues that are within the control of the society. Awareness should be increased to sensitize the people on the dangers of poor lifestyle and on the importance of living in clean environments. Public education should also be given to eliminate stigma against women in childless marriages who are invariably targeted regardless of whether they are fertile or not. The government has also a crucial role to play to increase the capacity of medical facilities to treat infertility diseases in facilitating the development of skilled medical personnel.
