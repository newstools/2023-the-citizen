Every year a couple of days before Valentine’s Day, the prices of red roses skyrocket, making them unaffordable for many wanting to treat the special person in their life. While it is always nice to get a beautiful bouquet of red roses, there are other flowers and flower arrangements that have an equally special connotation. “Flowers have a language of their own, and each type of flower conveys a different message. While red roses are often considered the traditional choice for Valentine’s Day, they are not the only option. In fact, there are many other flowers that can express your feelings just as beautifully, no matter what they’re for,” says florist Kylie Kaiser. Kylie says while red roses are the stock standard for Valentine’s Day, you shouldn’t exclude other flowers or arrangements that tells a story or narrative. “While red roses always share deep love and passion, deeper meaning and personalised, creative interpretations of love could add deeper meaning to an arrangement. And it doesn’t have to break the bank,” she says.
