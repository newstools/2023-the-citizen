A top US official on Tuesday described President Vladimir Putin’s accusations that Russia had been threatened by the West as justification for invading Ukraine as “absurdity”. “Nobody is attacking Russia. There’s a kind of absurdity in the notion that Russia was under some form of military threat from Ukraine or anyone else,” White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters. Speaking hours ahead of President Joe Biden delivering his own speech in Warsaw to mark the anniversary of Putin launching the war, Sullivan said the Kremlin leader was the aggressor. “This was a war of choice. Putin chose to fight it. He could have chosen not to. And he can choose even now to end it, to go home,” Sullivan said.

Ukraine stops fighting and the United States and the coalition stops helping them fight — then Ukraine disappears from the map,” he added. Previewing Biden’s speech, Sullivan said he would not “sketch out in any kind of specifics, a vision of a diplomatic end to the war.” Rather he will focus on the broader lesson of Ukraine in what he sees as an “inflection point” in a global struggle between democracies and autocratic regimes.
