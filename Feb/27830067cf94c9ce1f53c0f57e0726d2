The Hawks from the Pietermaritzburg Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit on Monday arrested a 40-year-old employee at the Office of the Premier in KwaZulu-Natal for two counts of fraud. According to the Hawks, the suspect was hired by the Premiers office as a project manager in 2010 after submitting fraudulent qualifications. He later secured a deputy director’s post in 2019.  Once it was discovered that his qualifications were fraudulent, disciplinary action was taken and a police report was filed.  “The Department of Public Administration conducted qualification verification and the suspect failed to submit the original documents as requested,” the Hawks said in a statement.
