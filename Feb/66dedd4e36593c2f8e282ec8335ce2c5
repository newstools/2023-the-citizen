Pirates, a hard running side, will try to impose their style of play on the defending champions, who will also look to play their shoeshine and piano brand of football. “When we play against Pirates, we want to dominate both halves and we have been training hard with high intensity to try to make sure that the boys are ready for the encounter,” said Onyango.   “Whenever we play them in Orlando, it is always interesting because they have the home advantage, but at the same time, we also have our crowd, the Masandawana who always come in numbers to cheer us up. We usually get good results when we play in Orlando and I hope the boys are ready for the fight. “Everyone is focused on the game and whenever we play Pirates it is always a great game. We just want to keep the momentum going because we have important games coming this month and the first one for this month is Pirates, who are going to be difficult away from home. But everyone is ready and fresh for the game.” Onyango has only played two games this season, having been dropped as the number one goalkeeper in favour of Ronwen Williams. The veteran says he has bee  waiting for his opportunity and will look to impress if picked to start against the Buccaneers. “We have a mentality where we know that we have to compete all the time and be ready when an opportunity comes because you never know when you are going to play.  “You need to be on your toes all the time.”
