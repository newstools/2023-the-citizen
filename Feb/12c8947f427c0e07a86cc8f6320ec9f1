The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have stormed the mayoral office in Tshwane and demanded the removal of political staff and mayoral committee members whom the party believed were no longer elected officials. This comes after Tshwane Mayor Randall Williams on Monday took many by surprise when he announced his decision to resign with effect from midnight. However, a few hours later he submitted another letter to Council Speaker Dr Murunwa Makwarela indicating that he had changed the resignation date to February 28, causing confusion as to which letter would be accepted as being valid by the council. The EFF has stormed the Tshwane Mayoral office on Thursday to demand the removal of MMC’s, staff after Mayor Randall Williams resignation. Williams is on special leave until the 28th of February and doesn’t plan to serve the remainder of his notice period. #Tshwane #EFF pic.twitter.com/iAZc1YHxNL Speaking to The Citizen, Sipho Stuurman from the Office of the Executive Mayor in Tshwane claims the EFF were unhappy there was no mayor to run the city. “The EFF stormed the mayoral offices and they forced out political staff ,such as the chief of staff Jordan Griffiths, out of their office claiming there is no government and that the mayor has resigned.” “Mayor Randall Williams, the outgoing mayor, is currently on special leave, while MMC Peter Sutton is the acting mayor until 28 February,” Stuurman said.

How they treated and frog-marched the staff out of the office is not acceptable. Fortunately, we do not have any serious injuries. The behaviour displayed by the EFF is simply unacceptable,” Stuurman said. The EFF in Tshwane has taken upon themselves to remove the Mayoral Committee in the City of Tshwane.
