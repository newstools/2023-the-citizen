Radio personality Mark Pilgrim has started chemotherapy after returning to the hospital over a week ago.  Pilgrim shared a heartbreaking photo of himself on 24 January, that was a heavy reminder of his fight with cancer. A week later, the Hot 102.7 FM presenter says the chemotherapy has left him feeling depleted.  Posting a picture of himself in bed, with his eyes close on Thursday, Pilgrim wrote: “A lot of sleeping the last few days. Body is depleted. After chemo and immuno last Thursday it’s just been pouring out both ends. I’m like a shrivelled pea.” As it has consisted the last couple of months of the media personality’s health updates, there was an outpouring of love.  ALSO READ: Penny Lebyane denies paying DJ Fresh any money TV presenter Maps Maponyane wrote: “I hope it’s evident just how many people are in your corner sending you love and strength.

Pilgrim was able to spend time with his family during the festive season and received his treatment from home, however, this didn’t last long as he hoped.  Posting a picture of himself on a hospital bed, Mark looked starkly skinnier, the radio host admitted to his drastic change in appearance.  He wrote: “Really skinny at the moment. Having more fluid drained from [my] abdomen so my tummy has a bit of space for food. It’s a journey. It’s not easy. Baby steps. Still have the end goal in sight where myself, Adrienne and the girls are walking on the beach with our future golden retriever”.  Celebrities such as international DJ Black Coffee, DJ Fresh, politician Fikile Mbalula, Pabi Moloi, Lalla Hirayama, actress Zenande Mfenyana, Leanne Manas and Olympic Gold Medallists Roland Schoeman sent Mark plenty of love and urged him to keep fighting.  READ NEXT: ‘You got this Mark’: Black Coffee, DJ Fresh and more rally behind Mark Pilgrim
