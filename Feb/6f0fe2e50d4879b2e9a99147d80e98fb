Dar es Salaam. In its wider efforts to enhance economic inclusion, CRDB Bank yesterday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Information and Communication Technologies Commission (ICTC) and Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (Costech). CRDB managing director Abdulmajid Nsekela said the MoU seeks to financially empower innovative youth in various sectors. “Our cooperation with this experienced government institution in empowering youth, will, to a large extent, enhance the programme to realise its goal,” he said. “For this programme to be effective and efficient, we have decided to search for like-minded partners.” ICTC and Costech, he said, have been doing a good job that reflects the government’s willingness in boosting trade and innovative ideas. The ICTC director general, Dr Nkundwe Mwasaga, said the MoU will facilitate access to capital for infant businesses in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. It will also help in improving innovative business ideas that will help in job creation, he added. The Costech director general, Dr Amos Nungu, said: “The MoU will be a catalyst for the growth of infant businesses in various sectors.” Meanwhile, CRDB yesterday officially announced the establishment of the CRDB Bank Foundation which will be responsible for initiating and implementing programmes that are innovative, sustainable and inclusive in nature. The programme’s target, Mr Nsekela said, will be to stimulate social and economic development. Mr Nsekela announced the CRDB Bank’s corporate affairs director, Ms Tully Esther Mwambapa, as the Foundation’s managing director. Ms Mwambapa urged innovative youth to be proactive in grabbing opportunities presented by the lender. “The MoU that we have entered today (yesterday), enables us to collaborate with ICTC and Costech to identify infant innovative businesses which require our support,” she asserted.
