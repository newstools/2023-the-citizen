A female lion escaped on Wednesday while it was being transported in the North West. Police in the province have warned the community that a lioness is on the prowl and precautions need to be taken. Police spokesperson Captain Aafje Botma said the lioness was being transported to a different location when it made its getaway. “A lioness escaped from her container whilst in transit on the back of a Ford Ranger bakkie on the Beesdam road between Stella and Tlagameng on Wednesday 22 February 2023. “The owner only realised that she escaped when he reached his destination at Tlagameng Nature Reservation and farmers are on the lookout for the animal,” Botma said. Speaking to The Citizen, Jerry Matebes from the Department of Economic Development, Conservation and Tourism in the North West province said two lions were being transported, and one escaped. “The owner of the two lions discovered a female lion had escaped as he stopped to check on the animals. The rescue mission that involves a chopper has since started and the mission will continue today.” Matebes has urged the community not attempt to capture the animal but rather contact the department or the police.
